"""
NetGravity — The analysis computed from an uploaded network
============================================================
A project's analysis is the authoritative KPI layer's complete reading of one
network snapshot: network KPIs, per-facility metrics, resilience and risk, lane
flows, triggered thresholds and the evidence package behind all of them.

Why this exists
---------------
It was recomputed from scratch on every request that touched it. Five KPI
endpoints each called the orchestrator independently, and the only thing
between them and a fresh MILP solve was a 120-second in-process cache written
AFTER the solve returned — so opening a project fired five concurrent solves of
the same network, and two minutes later fired five more. On the client network
that is twenty to forty seconds each.

Nothing about that computation is time-varying. A snapshot is immutable by
construction (`SnapshotManager.assert_fresh`), the solver is deterministic, and
the KPI layer is a pure function of the execution it reads. Recomputing it
produces the same answer at full price — and where a MILP has ties, it can
produce a DIFFERENT optimum of the same cost, so a user paging between screens
could watch facility assignments change underneath them.

So the analysis is computed once per network version, kept, and served.

Keyed by (snapshot_id, data_version)
------------------------------------
`data_version` is the snapshot's own version string. A stored analysis is only
ever returned for the exact network version it was computed from; re-uploading
data produces a new snapshot and a new analysis rather than showing yesterday's
answer against today's numbers. There is no TTL, because time is not what makes
this stale — a different network is.

Single-flight
-------------
Concurrent requests for an analysis that does not exist yet share ONE solve.
The previous arrangement had every caller start its own, then race to write the
cache, so the cost of a cold start scaled with how many panels the page opened
at once.

#: Bumped whenever the SHAPE of a serialised analysis changes.
#:
#: The cache key is `(snapshot_id, data_version, variant)`, and `data_version`
#: describes the NETWORK — it is a hash of facilities, products, demands and
#: lanes. Adding a block to the analysis document does not change any of those,
#: so every existing entry stays valid by that key and is served forever: the
#: code produces the new shape and no caller ever sees it, on exactly the
#: networks that have been analysed before.
#:
#: That is not hypothetical. It is how `horizon.by_facility` came back empty on
#: a network whose horizon was solved correctly — the answer was right and a
#: document written before the field existed was what got returned.
#: 3 — the document gained `currency`, and every money metric's `unit` changed
#: from the literal "INR" to the network's own currency. A cached v2 document
#: would be served back with rupee units over dollar figures.
#: 4 — the document gained `warehouse`: peak-versus-average health, the
#: rankings and the cost attribution per site. A v3 document has none of it,
#: and the warehouse screen reading one would show an empty footprint for a
#: network that was solved correctly.
#: 5 — `warehouse.optimized_business_cost` became `warehouse.business_cost`.
#: A RENAME inside the document is a shape change like any other: the model is
#: `extra="forbid"`, so a v4 document rehydrated by the new code raises rather
#: than degrading, and every previously analysed project served a 500 until
#: this was bumped. Adding a field is not the only thing that needs this.
