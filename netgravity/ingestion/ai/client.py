"""
NetGravity — LLM Client (single integration point)
===================================================
EVERY LLM call in the ingestion pipeline goes through this file.

WHY THAT MATTERS
----------------
1. API KEY PLACEHOLDER. The key is read from NETGRAVITY_LLM_API_KEY. It is
   deliberately not required. With no key set the client runs in STUB MODE
   and returns canned responses from ai/stubs.py, so the whole pipeline —
   and its entire test suite — runs end to end without credentials.
   Supplying the key later changes nothing but an environment variable.

2. PROVIDER ISOLATION. The team has not finalised the LLM provider. Swapping
   from Anthropic to anything else is a change to _call_live() in this file
   only. No adapter imports a vendor SDK directly.

3. AUDITABILITY. Every response records whether it came from a live model or
   a stub, and that flag is surfaced in the ingestion report — so nobody can
   mistake canned demo output for a real extraction.

# both files. That is a drift hazard with teeth here specifically: the budget
# is CUMULATIVE and SHARED across everyone holding the token, so a limit
# corrected in one file and not the other does not cause a local bug — it
# spends someone else's remaining capacity.

        Ask the model to read a PDF DOCUMENT directly, rather than text we

        WHEN THIS IS USED
            Only as an escalation. pypdf extraction runs first because it is
            free and instant; this path exists for the cases pypdf cannot
            serve — a scan with no text layer, or a text layer so garbled
            that pdf_quality.assess() refuses it. Sending the document costs
            meaningfully more than sending text, so it is never the default.

        PROVIDER SUPPORT IS NOT UNIFORM — READ THIS
            Native PDF input is a newer capability and is NOT implemented
            identically across providers. Anthropic and OpenAI each accept a
            base64 document but in different request shapes, and several
            OpenAI-COMPATIBLE providers (OpenRouter's free tier, Groq,
            Cerebras) support it only for some models or not at all.

            CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-08-21): Gemini via its OpenAI-compatible
            endpoint (the base_url swap this project uses) REJECTS the
            OpenAI "file" content-part with a 400 "Invalid content part
            type: file". This is the one path in the whole pipeline that
            was still untested against a live provider before this — now
            it is tested, and the answer for Gemini-via-OpenAI-compat is
            "not supported". The text-only path (extract_json, no PDF) DOES
            work against Gemini and was verified separately. Anthropic's
            real API (_pdf_anthropic) natively supports PDF documents and
            is the fastest fix if a Claude key becomes available — no code
            change needed there, just NETGRAVITY_USE_CLAUDE=true.

            This method therefore treats rejection as an ordinary failure,
            not a crash: a provider that will not take a document produces
            the same loud, labelled degradation as any other failed call.
            The caller keeps the pypdf warning and reports honestly that the
            document could not be read, which is the correct outcome — far
            better than silently returning invented figures for a document
            nobody could actually read.

        WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS PROVIDER
            - No JSON mode. "Return JSON" is asked for in the prompt and
              enforced by _parse_json(), which already tolerates prose and
              fences — so a chatty reply still parses.
            - No model choice, and max_tokens is ignored (fixed at
              GATEWAY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS server-side). A caller asking for
              more is warned rather than silently truncated.
            - No document/PDF input at all.
            - A SHARED, CUMULATIVE budget. Retries are therefore deliberately
              conservative: a rolling-minute 429 is worth waiting out, but a
              spent budget or daily cap is not, and a client-side timeout is
              never retried because the call may already have completed and
              been billed (there is no idempotency key to protect us).
