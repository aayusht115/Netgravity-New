"""
The multi-period MILP: what a horizon model must do that a collapsed one cannot.

The previous phase stopped a crash and then collapsed every period into one,
reporting that it had. This tests the model that replaced the collapse — flow,
demand, capacity and stock indexed by period — and in particular the things a
single-period model gets WRONG rather than merely approximates:

  * per-period capacity must bind per period, not over the horizon;
  * a peak the upstream cannot make in its own month must be servable by
    building stock ahead of it;
  * a fixed cost stated per period must be charged in every period;
  * a one-time cost must stay one-time.

Each of those is a different plan, not a different rounding.
