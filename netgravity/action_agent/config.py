NetGravity — Action Agent Configuration
=========================================
Single source of truth for every environment variable the Action Agent
needs. Mirrors netgravity/ingestion/config.py's shape deliberately: same
blank-means-stub-mode rule, same "real env vars win over .env" loading (the
ingestion config module already loads .env once at import time; importing it
here is enough to guarantee that has happened before these are read).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
----------------------
    NETGRAVITY_SMTP_HOST / NETGRAVITY_EMAIL_API_KEY
        Outbound email credential. Neither set => STUB MODE: no email is
        actually sent, every send is logged and recorded in the dispatch
        log as "would have emailed ...". This is deliberately the default —
        no outbound credential exists yet, and none should be requested as
        part of this work without explicit sign-off.
    NETGRAVITY_SMTP_PORT / NETGRAVITY_SMTP_USERNAME / NETGRAVITY_SMTP_PASSWORD
        Only read once NETGRAVITY_SMTP_HOST is set (i.e. once live mode is
        actually requested). Port defaults to 587 (STARTTLS). Most real
        providers (Gmail included) require both a username and a password —
        for Gmail specifically that password must be an App Password, not
        the account password, since SMTP auth needs 2FA-compatible
        credentials.
    NETGRAVITY_SMTP_USE_TLS
        "false" to disable STARTTLS (e.g. against a local test relay that
        has no TLS at all). Defaults true — real providers require it.
    NETGRAVITY_SMTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
        How long to wait on the SMTP conversation before giving up. Defaults
        to 20. A relay that black-holes packets rather than refusing them
        would otherwise hold the request thread for the OS TCP timeout, with
        a user watching a button that never comes back.
    NETGRAVITY_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS
        The From: header. Falls back to NETGRAVITY_SMTP_USERNAME, then to
        a placeholder — set this explicitly when it differs from the login
        account (e.g. a shared mailbox with per-app credentials).
    NETGRAVITY_EMAIL_STRICT
        "true" => a failed live send raises, instead of degrading to a
        labelled stub. Mirrors NETGRAVITY_LLM_STRICT.
    NETGRAVITY_INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN
        Domain used to build the Reply-To address on missing-data emails
        (ingest-{session_id}@<domain>). Blank is safe — the address is just
        left unset — since the inbound-email provider/DNS setup is a
        separate infrastructure prerequisite, not part of this codebase.
    NETGRAVITY_DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL / NETGRAVITY_DEFAULT_TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL
        Seed values only, used once to populate the notification-recipients
        store if it is empty. Fully editable afterward through the
        recipients store; never treated as permanent.
