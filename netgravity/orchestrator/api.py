"""
Orchestrator — HTTP service interface.

A Flask blueprint exposing the control plane. API schemas are the Pydantic
models in `orchestrator/schemas/`, kept separate from internal execution
classes, so the wire format can evolve without touching the core.

        `GET /orchestrator/executions/live?correlation_id=req_ab12cd34`

        Every other view of an execution is a view of a finished one:
        `/executions/<id>` and `/trace` both need an execution id, and a
        client only learns that id from the response — which arrives when the
        work is over. So the twenty to forty seconds of a cold solve were,
        from the client's side, silent, and a loading screen could say nothing
        true about them beyond "still waiting".

        The orchestrator has known all along. `ExecutionContext` carries
        `current_state`, `capability_status`, and the completed, failed,
        skipped and blocked step lists, and mutates them as the run proceeds.
        This route reads them, keyed on the id the BROWSER generated for its
        own HTTP request (`X-Request-ID`), which the API layer files each
        execution under as `<correlation>:<purpose>` — see
        `app.backend.services.correlation`.

        Read-only, and derived entirely from the live context: it computes
        nothing, stores nothing and starts nothing. An unknown correlation id
        is an empty list, not an error — the execution may not have been
        created yet, which is the ordinary state of affairs for the first poll
        of a request.

        Scoped to the caller. Executions are indexed process-wide, so without
        this an authenticated user holding someone else's correlation id could
        read the shape of their run. `/executions/<id>` predates this and does
