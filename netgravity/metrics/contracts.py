NetGravity — Deterministic Result Contract Builders
===================================================
Version: 1.4.0

Derives the frozen result contracts (`schemas/contracts.py`) from the engine's
native `OptimizationResult`.

Lives in `metrics/` because that is where NetGravity already derives structured
outputs from raw optimization results (see `metrics/kpis.py`). No optimization
or cost arithmetic happens here — cost components come from the existing
business-cost/reconciliation layer, so there is exactly one cost model.
