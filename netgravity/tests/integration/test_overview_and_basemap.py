"""
Home Overview, and the geography both maps stand on.

Two things are held here.

  * **The Overview page's shape.** The mockup (`Dump/home overview.png`) puts
    the three headline KPIs in the same band as the alert, above the fold. They
    used to sit in a strip BELOW both columns — off the bottom of a 1050px
    window, under a 712px map, with the floating chat button on top of them —
    so the three numbers the page exists to show were the three you had to
    scroll to reach.

  * **One set of coordinates for both maps.** The 2D map and the 3D twin each
    used to carry their own basemap: a raster photograph of India, applied only
    when the network happened to sit inside 4-39N / 65-100E. Anywhere else the
    2D map fell back to a bare graticule and the 3D plane to blank white, so a
    US network's twelve facilities floated over nothing while the counters
    beside them correctly reported 24 nodes and 51 corridors. Both now read
    `js/world-basemap.js`, and the 3D ground plane is the 2D map's own country
    rings projected through the same Mercator maths onto the same window.

These are asset-level checks because that is where the defects live: the
geometry is bundled JavaScript, and a browser test would report "the map looks
different" without naming which of the two views had drifted.
