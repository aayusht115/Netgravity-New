"""
One model request per completed analysis. Zero per view.

The rule, agreed: **a new analysis can justify a new call; viewing the same
analysis cannot.** These tests hold it as a measured number rather than a
convention — a counting gateway, and assertions on how far it moved.

Two failure modes are guarded specifically:

  * the agent runtime. `OpenAIAgentsReasoningRuntime` instructs the model to
    call `get_evidence` before citing each metric, so a briefing quoting six
    figures costs seven or more requests. "One call" must not mean "one agent
    run that quietly makes several".
  * a stale hit. An explanation keyed to a project rather than to the RESULT
    would survive a re-solve and describe a network that no longer exists.
