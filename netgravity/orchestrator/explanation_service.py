"""
NetGravity — Explanation Service
==================================
One model request per completed analysis. Zero per view.

THE RULE THIS ENFORCES, agreed with Aayush:

    A new analysis can justify a new call; viewing the same analysis cannot.

So every explanation goes through `explain()`, which:

  1. fingerprints the RESULT (execution id, data version, the set of scenario
     ids — whatever identifies it);
  2. returns the saved explanation when one exists for that exact
     fingerprint, spending nothing;
  3. otherwise builds the evidence UPFRONT, makes one request, and saves it.

Step 3 passes `single_request=True`, which forbids the agent runtime whatever
the environment selects — that runtime reaches the model once per metric it
cites, which is an agent loop rather than a request.

Everything a screen needs for one analysis is produced together — the
explanation, the missing-data wording and the reasons for eligible suggested
tests — because they are one call's output, not three panes' worth of calls.
