   this codebase has twice had to undo. What IS true is stated: the dots keep
   moving because a request is genuinely in flight.

   There is no clock. A count of seconds was shown here past ten seconds, on
   the reasoning that a long wait needs to be told from a dead one — but the
   moving words and dots already say the request is alive, and a number
   climbing next to them turns waiting into watching it climb.
