NetGravity — Infeasibility Diagnostics V1.1
=============================================
Pre-solve and post-solve diagnostic checks that explain WHY the model
is infeasible when the solver returns INFEASIBLE.

Purpose:
    When the optimizer returns INFEASIBLE, this module provides structured
    diagnostic information to help the analyst:
      1. Identify which markets have no supply arcs
      2. Estimate whether total capacity is sufficient for total demand
      3. Identify SLA-blocked markets (no arc meets service requirement)
      4. Identify markets blocked by forced-close facility constraints
      5. Estimate the minimum infeasibility gap

This module does NOT modify the network or attempt to repair it.
Principle: "Fail loudly with explanation."

Usage:
    from netgravity.diagnostics.infeasibility import diagnose_infeasibility
    diag = diagnose_infeasibility(network, config)
    if diag.has_issues:
        diag.print_report()
