/**
 * NetGravity — the agent loading screen
 * =====================================
 * The approved design (`Dump/avengersloading.html`): a small rectangular
 * dialog holding a vertical phase tree. Each phase is a node on a line — a
 * spinner while it runs, a green tick when it lands — with its title typed
 * out and its detail streaming underneath. Finished phases collapse away, so
 * what is on screen is what is happening now.
 *
 * This file draws. It decides nothing.
 *
 * The reference is a demo, and the difference matters. Its six phases are a
 * fixed list advanced by `setTimeout` every 1250ms, with invented logs —
 * "Recruiting Iron Man", "Simulating 14,000,605 outcomes". Nothing of that
 * kind is here. The phases ARE the dispatches the caller declared in
 * `startRun({ plan })`, they change state only when a request genuinely starts
 * and returns, and every log line is either the message the caller stated or a
 * fact read back from the orchestrator's own execution trace. A scenario run
 * shows two phases because it makes two requests; opening a project shows
 * five because hydration awaits five.
 *
 * The structure is built once and updated in place. Replacing an element
 * restarts every CSS animation inside it, and this screen is almost entirely
 * animation: rebuilding on each state change left the dialog stuck in the
 * opening frames of its own fade and re-typed every title from scratch.

/* ─── pacing ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The screen is deliberately behind the work.

   Events arrive at machine speed. A network that has been solved before
   reports five dispatches and twenty lines of detail inside two seconds, and
   a screen that draws each one the instant it arrives gives every line a
   twentieth of a second — which is the same as giving it none. Nielsen's
   first heuristic asks for visibility of system status, and a line nobody
   could read was never visible; the tenth asks that the system explain
   itself, and an explanation that flashes past explains nothing.

   So reveals are QUEUED, and released at reading speed. What is queued is
   only ever something that has already genuinely happened, released in the
   order it happened. The queue chooses WHEN a fact reaches the screen. It
   never chooses WHAT — that is `update`, reading the recorder, and nothing
   else in this file creates an item.

   Three consequences are handled openly rather than hidden:

     - The screen can fall behind. It speeds up as the backlog grows, to a
       floor, so it is never describing a past the system has left.
     - The dialog can outlast the work: `dismissAgentLoading` waits for the
       queue to drain, so the last thing that happened is read rather than
       flashed. That wait is bounded by `MAX_DRAIN_MS`.
     - Holding a reader has a cost, so there is a way out of it. "Skip to
       latest" and Escape release everything at once — Nielsen's third
       heuristic, and the reason pacing a person's wait is defensible at all.

   The elapsed clock is never paced: it counts real seconds from the real
   start, so the one number on the dialog that claims to be a duration always
   is one. Each phase states its own true duration for the same reason — a
   step held open for eight tenths of a second says, in its own words, that
   it took four hundredths. */
