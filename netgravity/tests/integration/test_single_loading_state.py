"""
One loading screen, and a form that is not pinned to one country.

THE LOADING STATE
-----------------
The application had three. The agent dialog, which reports real dispatches;
a scenario "execution view" drawn inside the scenario modal, six phases with a
spinner, showing the same wait the dialog was already covering the screen to
show; and `agent-reasoning.js` — a modal that advanced four stages on 450ms
timers, filled a progress bar to 100%, and printed lines like "NetGravity
Agentic Kernel v2.4 initialized" into a fake terminal, in front of a tab
change with no work happening behind it at all.

The chatbot is the deliberate exception. A modal over a conversation would
hide the thing the reader is waiting on, and a chat turn is a message in a
thread rather than a screen being rebuilt — so it waits inline, with a word
that changes so a long wait is legible.

THE NEW-SITE FORM
-----------------
"Jump to a city" offered thirty-two Indian cities on every network in every
country, and the latitude and longitude inputs carried India's bounding box as
their `min`/`max` — so on a US network the form opened at its own network's
centroid with the field already out of range, and the browser refused to submit
a scenario the solver would have accepted.
