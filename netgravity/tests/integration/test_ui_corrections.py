"""
Four corrections to screens that were already right about the figures.

  * **The scenario map's key did not fit its map.** It is the twin's own key
    plus three scenario rows — 456px — inside a panel that clamps to 360px on
    a short window. The panel is `overflow: hidden`, so the top of the key was
    simply cut off, taking the first group's heading with it.

  * **The Forecast screen carried a Facility and a Period picker.** Neither
    moves a demand forecast: a forecast is per market-product series, and the
    screen has its own picker for that. Two controls that look like scope and
    change nothing are worse than none.

  * **A facility on the map was a 13px emoji.** At the zoom a national network
    is framed at, a reader could see that a marker was there and not what it
    was — and the 3D scene said the same thing with a different vocabulary
    (a shape), while the key beside it printed an emoji that appeared nowhere
    in the scene.

  * **The recommendation card scrolled out from under the top bar.** It is
    `position: sticky` inside the same scroll container as the sticky top bar,
    pinned at 16px from the scrollport — behind it. And its column was sized
    to the card, so it had no travel and did not stick at all.
