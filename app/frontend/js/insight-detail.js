/**
 * NetGravity — Insight Deep Dive
 * ===============================
 * The full-page view of one finding. Reached by clicking a card in Home's
 * attention feed.
 *
 *   Home attention feed → DEEP DIVE (this page)
 *                          └→ "Run a scenario" → Scenario Planning tab
 *                          └→ "Open in Digital Twin" → Twin tab, on that site
 *
 * What this page shows, and only this
 * -----------------------------------
 * The finding as the engine stated it — headline, full narrative, theme,
 * severity — the evidence it cites with each metric's authoritative value and
 * source, and the recommendation the engine derived from the whole network.
 * Then two ways to act: test a change as a scenario, or look at the site in the
 * twin.
 *
 * What it used to show
 * --------------------
 * The previous version of this file was 836 lines and was annotated at the top
 * as "PROTOTYPE / MOCKED". It presented, as ordinary page content:
 *
 *   * a seven-month "Actual / Projected" utilisation trend chart, generated
 *     from a hash of the insight's id — no such series exists anywhere in this
 *     system, and none is computed;
 *   * a before/after cost table whose delta came from
 *     `synth(id, 'cost', 6, 18)`, i.e. between ₹6L and ₹18L chosen by hashing a
 *     string;
 *   * a service level of "94.6%" as a hardcoded literal;
 *   * an "amount at risk" of ₹8–32L, likewise hashed;
 *   * an editable "shift 8–18% of volume" slider recomputing all of the above;
 *   * a drafted e-mail to "Priya Mehta (Regional Planning Analyst)", a person
 *     who does not exist, cc'd to "West Region Operations";
 *   * Approve / Reject buttons which changed their own label and nothing else,
 *     and an "action taken" state asserting that something had happened.
 *
 * None of it was reachable, because nothing populated the insight feed — so it
 * had never been seen. Wiring the feed up made every line of it live, and a
 * hashed rupee figure beside a real one is indistinguishable to a reader. The
 * whole apparatus is gone rather than relabelled: a caveat under a fabricated
 * chart does not make the chart true, and this application's central promise is
 * that a number on screen came from the solver.
 *
 * The scenario button is the honest version of the shift slider. A planner who
 * wants to know what moving 12% of volume would cost can have that answered by
 * the MILP, which is what Scenario Planning is for.
 *
 * What the page reads as now, top to bottom
 * -----------------------------------------
 *   the headline          the conclusion, as the engine stated it
 *   the lede              its own prose explaining that conclusion
 *   the banner            the one figure the finding leads on
 *   the visual            a chart, or a scale against the threshold
 *   how this was reached  the figures in the order they were used
 *   recommended action    the step, and the button that goes there
 *
 * The order is the argument. Before this, the prose sat under the chart in a
 * footnote slot, the only thing between the figures and the recommendation
 * was a table, and the one control that promised to explain the finding
 * ("Why this finding?") was a disclosure toggle at the foot revealing the
 * narrative already printed at the top.
 *
 * Where each figure comes from
 * ----------------------------
 * Every slot is filled from data the backend actually computed, or omitted:
 *
 *   * the chart plots either the facilities/lanes the finding was computed over
 *     (`record.entities`, ranked, sent by `/api/insights`), or — for a
 *     utilisation or capacity finding on a network whose upload carried a
 *     capacity history — the client's OWN recorded utilisation per period
 *     (`OBSERVED_UTILISATION`), which is a measurement they supplied, not a
 *     solver output, and is labelled as such on the axis title;
 *   * the threshold line is `NETWORK_RECOMMENDATION.thresholds`, imported from
 *     the module that owns `UTILIZATION_THRESHOLDS`, never a literal 90;
 *   * the reasoning chain is the finding's own evidence rows, each with the
 *     value the engine computed, the role it played in reaching the finding,
 *     and the engine that computed it;
 *   * the headline banner restates the finding's first evidence figure. It is
 *     NOT an "amount at risk": no engine in this system produces one, so that
 *     banner shows a measured figure or does not appear;
 *   * the threshold scale draws a percentage against the configured
 *     utilisation threshold, and only for the themes that threshold judges —
 *     and only where no chart already carries the same comparison;
 *   * the recommended action is the finding's own (`recommendedAction`), and
 *     the button beside it resolves through `insightCta` — the same function
 *     the Overview tile uses, so the tile and the page it opens cannot
 *     disagree about what to do next.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "Actual vs Projected" pair on the trend chart. The
 * observed series is history; projecting it onto future utilisation would need
 * the forecast run through the network model per future period, which nothing
 * does. One real line is drawn instead of two, one of which would be invented.

 * and the thing being judged is visible as a distance rather than a
 * difference.
 *
 * NOTHING IS COMPUTED. §9 — the frontend never calculates an authoritative
 * figure. Both numbers are printed exactly as the engine formatted them
 * (`display_value`, and the threshold from `NETWORK_RECOMMENDATION.thresholds`
 * — never a 90 written into this file); the only arithmetic is turning a
 * percentage into a bar width, which is a drawing instruction, not a reading.
 * No derived number appears anywhere in the output.
 *
 * TWO GUARDS, and both are about not drawing a comparison the engine did not
 * make:
 *
 *   * the only threshold this page has is the UTILISATION one, so the scale
 *     is offered only to the themes it judges. A cost finding that happens to
 *     cite a percentage would otherwise be drawn against a 90% utilisation
 *     line, which is a comparison nobody made and every reader would read as
 *     one that had been;
 *   * a chart that already draws its own threshold line has made the
 *     comparison. Drawing it twice, at two granularities, gives a reader two
 *     places to look for one answer — so the scale fills the gap where there
 *     is no chart, or where the chart is not about a threshold, and stays out
