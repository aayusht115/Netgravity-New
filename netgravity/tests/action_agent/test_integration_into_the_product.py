"""
The Action Agent as it is wired into this product, rather than in isolation.

The package arrived on a feature branch with 65 tests of its own, all of
which pass unmodified. What none of them could cover is the join: this
repository has TWO ingestion paths, and the one the completeness gate was
written against is not the one the browser uses.

    netgravity/ingestion/pipeline.py   the full pipeline — profiling, AI
                                       column mapping, a review console.
                                       `check_completeness` reads its
                                       `TabularResult.network_rows`.

    app/backend/api/ingestion_dynamic.py
                                       what the upload screen actually
                                       posts to. Calls
                                       `network_extractor.build_network_
                                       from_dataframes` and hands the
                                       result to `network_assembler`.

So every missing-data action item and every missing-data email would have
fired for exactly zero real uploads. `app/backend/services/
completeness_adapter.py` closes that: it is an ADAPTER, not a second
checker — it builds the two dictionaries `check_completeness` reads and
calls the one implementation, so the required/optional registries stay in
one place and adding a field there is seen by both paths.
