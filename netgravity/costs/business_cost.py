NetGravity — Business Network Cost
===================================
Version: 1.0.0

Derives BUSINESS NETWORK COST from an OptimizationResult.

This module exists to make one distinction explicit and auditable:

    Solver Objective
        What the MILP mathematically minimises. It may contain artificial
        devices — notably the shortage penalty (default 1e6 per unmet unit) and,
        under ObjectiveMode.WEIGHTED_COST_CARBON, a carbon preference weight.
        These exist to steer the optimiser, not to state what the business pays.

    Business Network Cost
        The economic cost the business actually incurs on the network:

            C_business = C_facility + C_opening + C_transport
                       + C_handling + C_inventory + C_carbon*

        (*carbon only when genuinely priced — see below.)

    Shortage Penalty
        A penalty on unmet demand. NOT automatically a financial cost. Excluded
        by default and reported separately, because including it would invent a
        monetary value for lost demand. Unmet demand remains an important
        resilience diagnostic and is reported alongside, never folded in.

Why this matters
────────────────
Under disruption the resilience assessment enables shortage so unmet demand can
be measured. The penalty then dominates the objective by orders of magnitude
(a 5,300-unit shortfall at 1e6/unit is 5.3bn against ~61k of real network cost).
Differencing raw solver objectives would therefore measure the penalty, not the
business impact. Performance Impact must be computed from business cost.

Reuse, not a second cost model
──────────────────────────────
Component values come from `costs.reconciliation.reconcile_costs`, which
independently evaluates each component from the raw decision vectors
(y_i, x_ijvk, a_ij) and canonical network parameters. This module only SELECTS
which of those components constitute business cost. There is no parallel cost
arithmetic here.
