"""
NetGravity — Field Mapping Engine
==================================
Decides what every column in a record set means, by combining three
independent opinions.

    MEMORY      what a human already confirmed, scoped by evidence.
                Authoritative when it applies — a settled question is not
                re-asked, and no model call is needed to answer it.

    AI          reads the columns AND real sample rows, so it has context.
                This is the only method that can tell a "Weight" on a
                despatch register from a "Weight" on a product master.

    DICTIONARY  the static alias table. Context-blind and often silent, but
                free, instant and perfectly repeatable.

WHY RUN THE DICTIONARY AT ALL IF THE MODEL IS BETTER
----------------------------------------------------
Not for its answers — for its DISAGREEMENTS. The dangerous failure in column
mapping is not the ambiguous column, which gets flagged either way. It is the
column that maps confidently and wrongly, silently, because the header looked
obvious. A model's own confidence score cannot catch that: a model can be
95% sure and wrong. A second method with different blind spots can, because
when two independent approaches diverge, that divergence is evidence in
itself. Agreement is corroboration; disagreement is a flag. Neither is
available from one method alone.

The dictionary costs nothing meaningful: it is a local lookup, and the model
call was happening regardless.

THE STRICTER BAR FOR OPTIMISER-BOUND DATA
-----------------------------------------
Distributor data lands in the staging zone, where a wrong mapping costs a
bad forecast. Facility, product, demand and lane data becomes the
CanonicalNetwork the MILP solves against, where a wrong mapping costs a
wrong recommendation that looks authoritative.

Those are not the same risk, so they do not get the same bar. For
optimiser-bound content, model-and-dictionary agreement is NOT enough to
auto-apply: a human confirms once, and memory carries that confirmation
forward from then on.
