   * so the 30-second default aborted them — and aborting the fetch does not
   * stop the solve. The user was shown "Analysis unavailable: request timed

   * network at 5m19s. A scenario run assesses facility resilience, which is
   * one MILP solve per facility; the batch is cached by material fingerprint,
   * so the second scenario on that network took 31s — but nothing before it
   * asks for that batch, and the run that pays for it is the first one a user
   * makes. 300s aborted it with about twenty seconds to go.
