"""
One shell, one top bar, one type scale — and two maps that are actually
pointed at the network they draw.

These are the corrections that came back after the Overview rebuild, and they
are all defects of the SHELL rather than of any one screen:

  * **The top bar changed shape between pages.** Facility and Period sat in
    the top bar on Home and one row lower, in the sub-topbar, on every other
    tab. Two positions for one pair of controls, and a reader who had just set
    a facility on Home looking for it in the wrong row on the Digital Twin.

  * **Every page but Home stopped short of the right-hand edge.**
    `.main-content` capped at 1280px and Home alone opted out, so on any wide
    window the other four pages ended in a band of empty page.

  * **The shell sized to its own content.** `.app-shell` was `min-height:
    100vh` with an auto height, `.app-body` inside it was `flex: 1`, and the
    two sized off each other. Home — a page built to fit exactly — came out
    56px too tall, and the Digital Twin ran away completely: a 1140px map
    panel in a 1050px window. Every `height: 100%` inside the shell inherited
    the wrong number.

  * **Scenario Planning's baseline map was never framed.** `initMap` called
    `fitToNetwork` only on the branch that draws a plain network, so the one
    map built through the scenario branch kept the literal `center: [22.5,
    79.5]` it was constructed with. Its nodes and lanes were drawn correctly
    the whole time, several thousand kilometres off the edge of the viewport —
    which reads, exactly, as "the nodes and flows are not working".

Asset-level, for the same reason as the rest of this directory: the defects
live in a stylesheet rule and a missing call, and a browser test would report
"the map looks empty" without naming which of the two.
