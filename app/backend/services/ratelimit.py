"""
NetGravity — Request rate limiting
==================================
Two endpoint families need a limit for different reasons.

**Credential endpoints** (`/api/auth/login`, `/signup`, `/password/reset`) are
guessed at. The account lockout in `security.py` handles a sustained attack on
ONE account; this handles the other shape — a spray across many accounts from
one source, which never trips a per-account counter.

**Solve endpoints** (`/api/kpis/*`, `/api/scenarios/simulate`, `/orchestrator/*`)
are expensive. One caller can occupy every worker with MILP solves and the
platform stops responding for everyone else without any malice being involved.

Design
------
A fixed-window counter per (bucket, client), **held in durable storage and shared
by every worker**.

It used to be held in process memory, and that was stated as a known limit: with
N workers a caller got N budgets. The trouble with that trade is which way it
fails. The limit exists to stop a caller occupying every worker with MILP
solves — and the moment you add workers to survive that load, the limit
loosens by exactly the factor you added. The number a deployment advertised was
never the number it enforced, and the gap grew with the deployment.

The counter is now one row updated by one atomic statement, so a burst arriving
simultaneously on four workers is counted four times against one budget rather
than once each against four. That costs one round trip per limited request —
paid only on credential and solve endpoints, which are the expensive ones
anyway, and set against a MILP solve it is not measurable.

Redis would be faster and is what many deployments reach for. It is not used
here because it would be a second datastore to run, secure, back up and monitor
for one small document per active caller. Azure Blob ETags provide the atomic
increment this application needs without another service.

If the database is unreachable the limiter falls back to a per-process window
rather than to no limit at all — a degraded limit is still a limit, and an
outage of the store must not become an open door.

The client is identified by the authenticated user where there is one, and by
the peer address otherwise — with `X-Forwarded-For` honoured ONLY when
`NETGRAVITY_TRUSTED_PROXY=1`, because a header anyone can set is a way to evade
the limit, not a way to enforce it.
