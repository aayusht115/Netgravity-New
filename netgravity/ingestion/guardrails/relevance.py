"""
NetGravity — Signal Relevance Scoring
======================================
The gate every external signal must pass before it can influence the
forecast (Layer 3) or a scenario (Layer 4).

AUDITABILITY IS THE POINT
-------------------------
Signals that fail are NOT discarded. They are stored with passed=False and a
written reason, so a planner can see what the system chose to ignore and why.
A silent filter would be indistinguishable from a broken one.
