"""
Phase 4A — Extraction / Parsing Agent, end to end.

    client files → ExtractionParsingAgent → CanonicalNetwork → snapshot
                 → existing MILP → existing REI

THE ARCHITECTURAL CLAIM THESE TESTS DEFEND
──────────────────────────────────────────
The data-ingestion pipeline is the **client-data implementation component of
the Extraction / Parsing Agent**, not a separate agent. Two consequences are
asserted structurally rather than described:

* there is exactly ONE canonical model — the ingestion package imports MAIN's
  `netgravity.schemas.network` and builds a `CanonicalNetwork` directly, so
  there is no adapter between two competing representations and no chance of
  them drifting;
* there is exactly ONE snapshot mechanism — an extracted network is registered
  through the orchestrator's existing `SnapshotManager`, which is what makes
  material fingerprinting, REI cache keys and stale-evidence checks apply to
  ingested data without any of them being modified.

DATA
────
`data/mock/india` is fabricated and gitignored. `scripts/generate_mock_dataset.py`
regenerates it deterministically; the module-scoped fixture below builds it on
demand, so these tests run on a fresh clone with no manual step. Nothing here
depends on real client files.

NO NETWORK CALLS. Every extraction runs with `allow_ai=False`, so the ingestion
pipeline stays in rules/stub mode and the suite consumes no LLM capacity.
