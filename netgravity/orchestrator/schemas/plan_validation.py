"""
Orchestrator — Typed planning outcomes.

A plan that fails validation must not reach the executor, and the reason must be
machine-readable rather than a sentence in a log. Phase 8.4 will build failure
management on top of these reasons, so each one names a distinct situation that
calls for a distinct response.

Everything here is data. Nothing in this module inspects a plan or decides
anything — see `core/plan_graph.py` for the checks that produce it.

    Why a plan was refused.

    Each value is a different problem with a different owner, which is why they
    are not collapsed into one "invalid plan":

    NO_WORKFLOW_FOR_INTENT   Nothing knows how to answer this kind of request.
                             The request is unsupported — not malformed.

    UNKNOWN_CAPABILITY       A step names something the registry does not hold.
                             A planning bug, or a capability that was removed.

    NOT_PLANNABLE            The capability exists and is executable, but a
                             planner may not select it independently. Service
                             and embedded capabilities are reached through the
                             thing that owns them.

    MISSING_HARD_DEPENDENCY  A step needs a result that no step in this plan
                             will produce and the context does not already
                             hold. Executing would refuse at the seam anyway;
                             refusing here says so before any work is done.

    UNSATISFIABLE_INPUT      A declared required input has no supplied value.

    DEPENDENCY_CYCLE         The graph cannot be ordered.

    INVALID_ORDERING         A step is placed before something it depends on.

    DUPLICATE_STEP           Two steps share an id, so results would collide.

    EMPTY_PLAN               Nothing to do. Distinguished from a failure: it
                             usually means every capability the request needed
                             is already satisfied in this context.

    BLOCKED_BY_FAILURE       A prerequisite already FAILED in this context. The
                             planner does not retry it — Phase 8.4 owns that
                             decision — so it reports the block and stops.
