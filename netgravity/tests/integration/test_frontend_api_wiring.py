"""
NetGravity — Frontend ↔ Backend Integration & API Wiring Tests
==============================================================
Validates that all REST endpoints, DTO serialization, authoritative KPI
responses, scenario simulations, and error states match the integration
contracts.

Phase 10.0 note — why these assertions changed
----------------------------------------------
Every test below is preserved in intent: each still asserts that its endpoint is
reachable and returns a well-formed DTO. What changed is that several of them
previously asserted behaviour the Phase 10.0 forensic audit identified as
defects, so passing them REQUIRED the defect to exist:

  * `test_login_success` logged in as a seeded user with the password
    "password" — the endpoint accepted any password at all.
  * `test_signup_success` registered an account with **no password field**.
  * `test_me_endpoint` asserted HTTP 200 with **no Authorization header** —
    that is the authentication bypass itself, asserted as a contract.
  * `test_list_projects` asserted `len(projects) >= 5`, which only held because
    five fabricated projects were hardcoded into the module.
  * `test_list_scenarios` asserted `>= 2`, holding only because two fabricated
    scenarios were hardcoded.
  * `test_simulate_scenario_contract` asserted the presence of `totalCost` and
    `sla` — the literal fabricated fields the endpoint returned instead of the
    real solve it had just performed.
  * `test_get_forecast` asserted a 24-point history and 6-point cone, which held
    only because both were hardcoded constants.
  * `test_get_signals` asserted `>= 3` signals, holding only because three
    fabricated market bulletins were hardcoded.

These are updated to the corrected contract rather than deleted, and coverage is
extended: each now also asserts the property that replaced the defect.
