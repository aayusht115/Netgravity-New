NetGravity — Truly Independent Cost Reconciliation Engine V1.2
================================================================
Independently computes all objective cost components directly from:
  1. facility_decisions (y_i)
  2. flow_decisions (x_ijvk)
  3. assignment_decisions (a_ij)
  4. network parameters (facilities, lanes, products, demands)
  5. OptimizationConfig (cost_period, shortage_penalty, etc.)

Crucial Design Requirement (V1.2):
This module does NOT use result.objective_components as the source of truth!
It evaluates cost components strictly from raw decision vectors and network data.
It compares solver_objective vs independently_calculated_total.
Under V1.2 Direct MILP inventory formulation, solver_objective == independently_calculated_total (gap = 0.00).
