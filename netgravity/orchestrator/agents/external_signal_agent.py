"""
Orchestrator — External signal interpretation.

Turns outside-world text ("severe flooding expected around Delhi next week")
into a structured `ExternalSignal` carrying event type, location, likelihood and
full provenance.

The governing rule: **external information is EVIDENCE, never observed network
truth.** A signal supplies P for the RF calculation and nothing else. It is
never merged into a network snapshot, and the entities it names are re-matched
against the real network before use — a signal cannot introduce a facility.

Likelihood is only ever taken from what the source actually states. When no
likelihood is available the field stays None and RF is simply not computed for
that entity; a fabricated probability would flow straight into a governance
threshold, which is exactly the kind of invented number this system must not
produce.

#: Severity vocabulary → categorical severity. Note this maps to SEVERITY ONLY.
#:
#: There is deliberately NO severity → probability table here. A previous
#: version derived likelihood from severity ("severe" ⇒ P = 0.7), which
#: conflated two independent variables: a catastrophic event can be very
#: unlikely, and a trivial one near-certain. Feeding severity into RF as P
#: produced numbers with no defensible basis that then drove governance
#: thresholds. Probability is now taken only from an explicit statement in the
#: source; otherwise it stays None and RF reports NOT_COMPUTABLE.

#: Phrases that state a probability explicitly. Only these produce a P.

#: Every pattern requires probability VOCABULARY adjacent to the number. That is
#: the whole safety property: a bare numeral ("reduce by 20") can never become a
#: likelihood, and no amount of severity language produces one either. The list
#: was extended in Phase 3.1 after evaluation showed three explicitly-stated
#: forms silently yielding None — "0.35 probability of", "15 percent chance",
#: and "probability 0.8" with no colon. Each of those is a source stating a
#: likelihood outright, and dropping it meant RF refused to compute for a risk
#: the user had actually quantified.
