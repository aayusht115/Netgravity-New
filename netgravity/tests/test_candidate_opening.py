"""
Does the optimiser actually open a candidate warehouse when demand grows?

This exists because a live demo raised the opposite suspicion: a +50% demand
scenario came back with strain rather than a newly opened site, and it was not
clear whether the mechanism worked at all, whether the dataset had a candidate
in it, or whether something silently excluded candidates from the decision.

The answers, pinned here so they cannot quietly change:

  * At +50% the solver does NOT open a candidate, and that is correct — the
    existing DCs still hold the demand, and opening a site costs more than it
    saves. "It didn't open a warehouse" is an answer, not a failure.
  * At +75% existing capacity is genuinely short, and the solver opens one on
    its own. This is the behaviour the demo could not demonstrate.
  * Past the point where the REACHABLE network can serve the demand at all,
    the ENGINE CALL below comes back INFEASIBLE with every KPI zeroed — no
    shortfall and no diagnosis. That is still true of `milp.solve()` and is
    deliberate: `milp.py` is the formulation, it is guarded against incidental
    edits, and a second solve is not part of the model.

    It is no longer what anyone sees. Every product path goes through
    `OptimizationClient`, which already decided what to do with an infeasible
    solve and now also diagnoses it — the shortfall in units, the markets it
    falls in, and any CANDIDATE the optimiser would open. See
    `netgravity/optimization/infeasibility.py`, and
    `tests/integration/test_infeasibility_diagnosis.py` for the whole path
    from the solver to the screen.

The fixture is used rather than a client dataset because it is the only network
in the repository that genuinely carries CANDIDATE facilities with lanes.
