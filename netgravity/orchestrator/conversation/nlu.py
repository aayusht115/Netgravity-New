"""
Orchestrator — Natural-language understanding.

Converts user text into a validated `ConversationalIntent`. That is the whole
job. This module does not choose a workflow, does not call an engine, and does
not produce a number.

    text → IntentAgent (existing rules + LLM tiers)
         → EntityResolver (authoritative master data)
         → ambiguity adjudication
         → ConversationalIntent

The existing `IntentAgent` is REUSED rather than reimplemented — it already has
a tested rule parser, a constrained LLM prompt, capacity extraction and
facility-id filtering. What it lacks, and what this layer adds, is the ability
to say "I am not sure" and ask.

WHY AMBIGUITY IS ADJUDICATED HERE AND NOT IN THE MODEL
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A model asked "is this ambiguous?" will answer confidently either way. Whether
"close Delhi" is ambiguous is a fact about the NETWORK — how many Delhi nodes
exist, and what operations are defined on them — not a matter of language. So
it is decided deterministically, from the resolver's output, and the model's
opinion is not consulted.
