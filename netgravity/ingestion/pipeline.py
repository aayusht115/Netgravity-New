"""
NetGravity — Ingestion Pipeline Orchestrator
=============================================
Wires the adapters, validation, builder, snapshot and (optionally) contracts
and signals into a single run.

FLOW
----
    source files
        -> adapters        (parse + row-level validation)
        -> builder         (assemble CanonicalNetwork)
        -> engine checks   (netgravity.validation.checks — reused, not rewritten)
        -> snapshot        (content-addressed, immutable)
        -> IngestionReport (what the CLI prints)

Contracts and signals are optional side-channels: they enrich the run but are
never required for it to succeed, so a missing contracts/ folder or an absent
LLM key degrades gracefully instead of failing the pipeline.
