NetGravity — Network Builder
=============================
Assembles validated rows into the engine's CanonicalNetwork.

This module is the seam between ingestion and the optimisation engine.
It IMPORTS the engine's schemas; it never modifies them. CanonicalNetwork
is the finish line — ingestion's entire job is to produce a valid one.

Cost adjustments extracted from contracts are applied HERE, at assembly
time, so that:
    lane.rate_per_unit          stays the contracted (headline) rate
    effective rate              is computed and reported separately

See schemas/contract.py for why that separation matters.

    Catch demand and capacity landing on DIFFERENT time periods.

    This is the safety net for a real ambiguity in the client workbook:
    Daily_Demand_Units states its period in its name, but Capacity_Units does
    not (the workbook calls it "units/day or units/year" and then gives a
    "units/month" example). If demand is scaled to MONTH and capacity is not,
    the model reports a confident INFEASIBLE for a network that is actually
    healthy — the worst possible failure, because it looks like a real answer.

    Names cannot always tell us, so this checks the NUMBERS: a demand-to-
    capacity ratio sitting near 30, 12 or 7 is far more likely to be a unit
    error than a genuine 30x shortfall.

    Both sides of the ratio are PER PERIOD. A demand table may state many
    planning periods — twelve months of history is the ordinary shape — while
    `capacity_units_per_period` is, by its name, one period's worth. Adding the
    periods up and dividing by one period's capacity manufactures a ratio equal
    to the length of the horizon, which for a twelve-month table lands inside
    the tolerance around 12x and reports "monthly capacity against annual
    demand" for a network whose units are perfectly consistent. That is this
    check producing exactly the confident wrong answer it exists to prevent.

    The PEAK period is the one compared, not the mean: the network has to fit
    the month it is busiest, and averaging hides the month it breaks in.
