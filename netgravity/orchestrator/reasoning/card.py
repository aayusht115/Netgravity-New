NetGravity — the explanation card
===================================
One shape for every explanation on every screen:

    headline   the conclusion, in plain business English
    meaning    why it matters, one short sentence
    warning    the one thing that must not be missed (may be empty)
    next_step  one action (may be empty)
    figures    up to three supporting numbers — SUPPLIED BY CODE
    details    the technical account, collapsed by default

WHY IT IS THIS SHAPE. The screens were showing one conclusion as six things:
a headline, a paragraph, an insight, an evidence table, a recommendation and
a technical note. Repeating a finding does not reinforce it; it makes one
message read as six, and the reader stops looking for the one that matters.

THE DIVISION OF LABOUR. The model writes `headline`, `meaning`, `warning` and
`next_step` and writes NO NUMBERS AT ALL. Code produces `figures`, already
formatted in the project's own currency.

That split is not stylistic. It fixes three faults at once:

  * currency drift — a comparison table in $ beside a recommendation in ₹,
    because the model wrote a figure and had no idea what the project uses;
  * grounding leakage — "[UNGROUNDED CLAIM REMOVED — authoritative ... ]"
    appearing on screen, which is internal validation text. A model that
    writes no figures gives grounding nothing to redact;
  * duplication — the same number stated in prose and again in a table.

Grounding still runs. It simply finds nothing to strip, which is the point.
