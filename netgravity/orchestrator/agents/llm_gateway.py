"""
Orchestrator — Text Generation Gateway client.

Client for the NetGravity text-generation gateway (`POST /v1/generate`).

CREDENTIAL HANDLING
───────────────────
The token is read from the environment ONLY:

    export TEXT_API_URL="https://<gateway-host>"
    export TEXT_API_TOKEN="<token>"

It is deliberately never hardcoded, never defaulted to a literal, never logged
and never echoed into a prompt or error message, per the gateway's own security
guidance. If `TEXT_API_TOKEN` is unset the gateway reports itself unavailable
and the orchestrator degrades to its deterministic path.

GATEWAY CONSTRAINTS (these shape the design)
────────────────────────────────────────────
* The request body accepts exactly one field, `prompt`. There is no system
  role, no temperature, no tool calling, no model selection. All instruction
  must therefore be inlined into the prompt string, and every response must be
  parsed defensively.
* Limits are SHARED across all consumers: a cumulative USD budget, 100
  requests/day, 20 requests/rolling-minute, 100k prompt characters, 2000 output
  tokens, 60s processing timeout.
* Because capacity is shared and small, the LLM is treated as a best-effort
  enhancement. Every deterministic result stays valid without it.

RETRY RULES (from the integration guide)
────────────────────────────────────────
* Client timeout ~90s, slightly above the gateway's 60s processing timeout.
* Retry ONLY explicit transient 429 / 500 / 502, with exponential backoff and
  jitter, few attempts.
* NEVER auto-retry a client-side network timeout: the original call may have
  completed, and the gateway accepts no idempotency key, so retrying can
  duplicate work and consume shared budget twice.
