"""
Phase 3 §22–§23 — the deterministic boundary, and attempts to cross it.

Two kinds of test here.

**Architectural invariants** assert the permitted call chain structurally, by
reading source and inspecting types. A behavioural test can only show that a
boundary held for the inputs tried; these show there is no code path across it
at all.

    permitted:   LLM → Intent → Orchestrator → Workflow → engines
                     → evidence → Reasoning → Grounding → Governance
    rejected:    LLM → MILP / REI / RF / Governance / action execution

**Prompt injection** attempts to make the model produce an authoritative value,
issue an instruction, or execute an action. Every attempt must end with the
deterministic engines still supplying the numbers.
