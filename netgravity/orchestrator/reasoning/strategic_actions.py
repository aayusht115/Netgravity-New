Orchestrator — What a leader should DO about a finding.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
================
Three screens used to answer "what should I do about this?" and only one of
them answered it. The scenario planner derived a real intervention from the
solved per-site load. The Insights feed looked the finding's THEME up in a
static table and returned "Open the KPI page to see which sites are over the
threshold" — which is not a recommendation, it is a navigation instruction,
and it is the same sentence for every network ever uploaded. The Forecast card
did the same thing in different words.

A senior reader does not need to be told which screen to open. They need to be
told what to change, where, and on what evidence — and then handed the means to
test it before committing. That is what this module produces, from the solved
facility rows, for every caller that has them.

WHERE THE SCENARIO PLANNER FITS
-------------------------------
`app/backend/api/scenarios.py` runs the same ladder over a RICHER input and
keeps its own copy of it. That is deliberate, and it is the one duplication
here worth having: it holds a full capacity account — every solved site, and
which regions have run out of room — where this module sees only the rows it
is handed. Asked to decide "every site in this region is full" from a subset,
`_region_without_room` would conclude it from whatever it was given, which is
how a recommendation to build somewhere gets made on three rows.

What the two DO share is the vocabulary: `ACTION_KEYS` is imported there
rather than restated, and both emit the same `scenario` prefill and the same
words under the button. A key added here and not there produces a card the
scenario screen cannot map to a form, which is the failure the shared tuple
prevents.

THE LADDER
----------
Cheapest defensible intervention first. The order is not a preference; each
rung is only reachable because the one above it does not apply:

    1. REOPEN_FACILITY     capacity that already exists and is already paid
                           for. Nothing built. Always beats building.
    2. ADD_CAPACITY        a site is at or near its ceiling and there is
                           nothing closed to bring back. Expanding a site that
                           already has land, labour and a licence beats a
                           greenfield.
    3. OPEN_NEW_FACILITY   every site in the region is full and none is
                           closed. This is the ONLY condition under which
                           building is the cheapest answer rather than the
                           first one somebody thought of.
    4. CONSOLIDATE         the opposite finding: sites carrying full fixed
                           cost for a fraction of their capacity.
    5. SCOPE_DEMAND_GROWTH growth stated for the whole network when the
                           upload knows which region it is happening in.
    6. REQUEST_DATA        the analysis ran without an input it needed.
    7. NO_ACTION           nothing meets the bar. A finding, not a blank.

EVERY RUNG ENDS IN A TEST, NEVER IN A COMMITMENT
------------------------------------------------
`scenario` on each action is the pre-filled scenario the recommendation would
be PROVED by. It is what turns "establish a distribution centre in the west"
from an opinion into something a planner can put a number against before it
reaches a capital committee — and it is why the button under a recommendation
reads "Test this as a scenario" rather than "Apply". Nothing here commits
anything; the governance layer still decides what may be executed.

WHAT THIS MODULE MAY NOT DO
---------------------------
It states no saving, no payback and no magnitude of benefit. None of those has
been solved at the point a recommendation is made — the scenario it hands over
is what produces them. A recommendation that quotes a saving nobody computed is
the exact failure the numeric grounding layer exists to catch, and it would be
caught here as UNSUPPORTED.

Figures that DO appear are read straight off the authoritative rows: a
utilisation the MILP reported, a capacity the upload stated. Nothing is
divided, summed or inferred.

    `limit` caps the list because a recommendation that names five things has

    feed, and the ladder is ordered so the three kept are the three that matter.

    ONE NETWORK, SEVERAL QUESTIONS
    ------------------------------
    The three arguments below exist because this ladder has two different jobs
    and used to do only the first.

    Asked "what should be done about this NETWORK", the answer is the top rung
    and the cross-rung suppression is right: do not propose consolidating a
    site while another one is on fire.

    Asked "what should be done about THIS FINDING" — which is what an insights
    feed asks, once per card — the same call returned the same top rung every
    time. Seven findings on one loaded network, seven identical sentences, six
    of which did not answer the finding printed above them: a card reporting
    idle sites recommended bringing more capacity online.

      `focus_ids`  the sites the finding is ABOUT. Within each rung these sort
                   first, so a card headed "Nagpur DC is at 97%" recommends
                   expanding Nagpur DC rather than whichever site happens to be
                   busiest network-wide.
      `prefer`     the rungs that ANSWER this finding, best first. The result
                   is filtered to these and ordered by them. Passing it also
                   lifts the cross-rung suppression, because a network can have
                   a saturated site AND an idle one and both are real findings
                   with opposite answers.
      `exclude`    rungs an earlier finding has already claimed, so two cards
                   in one briefing cannot print the same recommendation.

    With `prefer` set, an empty list is a legitimate answer — this finding has
    no intervention in the data — and the caller says something else. NO_ACTION
    is only ever returned for the network-wide question, where "nothing meets
    the bar" is itself the finding.
