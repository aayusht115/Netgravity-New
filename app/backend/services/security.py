"""
NetGravity — Authentication & Session Security
==============================================
Replaces the prototype auth path, which verified no password, auto-provisioned
any unknown email as a valid user, and fell back to an authenticated default
user whenever a token was missing or invalid.

Credentials are PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with per-user salts, stored as durable
records (Azure Blob in production).
On top of that this module now provides the things that separate a credential
store from an identity system:

  * **Brute-force resistance.** Failed attempts are counted per identity IN THE
    DATABASE and the account is locked for a cooling-off period. A lockout held
    in process memory resets on restart and is invisible to a second web
    worker, so it is not a lockout.
  * **Password reset.** Single-use, expiring, rate-limited tokens of which only
    the HASH is stored, delivered through a pluggable channel. Redeeming one
    revokes every existing session for that account.
  * **Second factor.** TOTP (RFC 6238) with recovery codes, verified against a
    step that is claimed atomically so a code cannot be replayed inside its own
    30-second window.
  * **Session hygiene.** An idle timeout that slides, an ABSOLUTE deadline that
    does not, rotation on credential change, and "sign out everywhere".
  * **httpOnly cookies.** The browser no longer holds a token JavaScript can
    read. See `session_cookie` below for why, and for what still uses bearer
    tokens.

It is still not an identity provider — there is no SSO, no SCIM, no directory —
and a deployment with an IdP should front it with one. What it now is, is an
account system that survives the attacks a login form actually meets.
