"""
Phase 3 §21–§24 — the conversational chain end to end.

    USER → CHATBOT → NLU → structured intent → ORCHESTRATOR
         → workflow decision → deterministic engines → reasoning
         → grounding → governance → reply

The MILP, REI, RF, grounding and governance are all REAL here. Only the LLM is
ever faked, and only where a test needs a specific model failure or a specific
hallucination — a real model cannot be relied upon to misbehave on cue.

Numbers come from the hand-calculable `PHASE2_DELHI` fixture:

    C0 = 1,200 ; REI(DELHI) = 0.80 ; with P = 0.70 ⇒ RF = 0.94
