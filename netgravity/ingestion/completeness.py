"""
NetGravity — Data Completeness Gate
=====================================
Deterministic, rule-based check for whether an uploaded dataset has enough
data to run the network analysis, and separately, whether it has enough to
get the RICHEST possible results.

WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE ENGINE'S OWN VALIDATION
------------------------------------------------------
netgravity.validation.checks answers "is this CanonicalNetwork solvable".
By the time a CanonicalNetwork exists, every FacilityRecord/LaneRecord/
DemandRecord field has already been defaulted (e.g.
`fixed_cost_per_year: float = 0.0`), so "the client never sent this column"
and "the client sent zero" are no longer distinguishable.

This module runs one step earlier, against `TabularResult.network_rows` —
the canonically-renamed dict rows produced by ai/field_mapper.py right after
column mapping and before any Pydantic record is built. That is the only
point in the pipeline where column absence is still a fact, not a default.

No model call. No judgement calls about data quality. Just: was this column
present with a non-blank value, for this specific record.
