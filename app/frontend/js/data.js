// + ΣF_j·y_j (fixed facility, unchanged since footprint is fixed) +
// ΣP_unmet·u_k (shortage penalty, ₹10,000/unit) + SLA-pen, per the KPI
// Formula/Logic Verification's Total Network Cost definition.
//
// This is NOT the same figure as SCENARIOS' SCN_REBALANCE ("Recommended"):
// that scenario allows volume reallocation across plants and is a candidate
// action a user opts into, whereas the Optimized Base Case is the routing-
// only floor achievable with zero footprint change. Do not conflate them —
// every screen that shows a "Baseline Cost" / "Optimized Cost" / "Savings"
// figure for S6 must call this function rather than reading SCENARIOS or
// getNetworkKpis() (both are separate, independently-owned figures).
//
// Provenance: DEMO. No live optimizer is wired into this prototype, so
// these numbers are hand-authored to be internally consistent (fixed cost
// unchanged, transport cost improved, shortage penalty cleared by better
// routing) rather than fabricated as if they were a solver result. Once a
// real deterministic engine is wired in, this function's body — not its
// call sites — is what gets replaced, and `source` becomes DETERMINISTIC_ENGINE.
