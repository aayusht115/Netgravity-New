/**
 * NetGravity — Warehouse Deep Dive
 * =================================
 * Peak against average, ranked, and sized against a stated growth rate.
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES
 * --------------
 * The upper half of the KPI dashboard — one screen with the selected-facility
 * detail that screen already had, not a band above it. There is one facility
 * population here and one report of it, and the questions come in this order:
 *
 *   * Which of my twenty sites should I look at first?
 *   * Is the site that looks comfortable comfortable in its worst month?
 *   * — and only then — what is happening at that one site?
 *
 * ONE EXPORT
 * ----------
 * This file writes no file. The screen's export is a PDF of the view as it
 * is drawn — the print stylesheet in `style.css` — so there is no
 * second serialisation here to drift from what is on screen.
 *
 * ONE VOCABULARY
 * --------------
 * A DC and a warehouse are the same site. This band is the standard facility
 * view of the network, not a report about a separate kind of building, so it
 * uses the words the rest of the product already uses: "Distribution Centre"
 * for the role, "facility" for the collective. Two words for one thing sends
 * the reader hunting for a distinction there is none of.
 *
 * The identifiers below still read `wh-` and the endpoint is still
 * `/api/kpis/warehouse`. Those are not shown to anyone, and renaming a stored
 * document's keys to change a caption would invalidate every cached analysis
 * for no reader's benefit.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 * -------------------
 * It computes nothing. Every figure is read from `/api/kpis/warehouse`, which
 * reads the solved state through the authoritative KPI registry. The one thing
 * this file decides is ORDER — which row to put at the top — and it takes the
 * band that decides that from the backend too.
 *
 * NEVER PUT A BACKTICK IN AN HTML COMMENT IN THIS FILE
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * The markup below is written in template literals, so a backtick inside an
 * HTML comment ENDS the template and the rest of the function is parsed as
 * code. It happened once, in a comment explaining a units label: this module
 * stopped parsing, `app.js` imports it statically so the whole module graph
 * went with it, and the visible symptom was three screens away — the landing
 * page lost its world map, because `initLandingPage()` never ran. The full
 * test suite passed throughout, because every frontend test here reads these
 * files as text and no JS engine exists in the test environment to parse them.
 *
 * ABSENCE IS RENDERED, NOT SKIPPED
 * --------------------------------
 * Three sections here can be empty because an input is missing rather than
 * because there is nothing to report: the growth sizing (no rate stated), the
 * before-and-after (no second solve run), and per-site stock (a model that
 * carries none). Each arrives with a status and a reason, and each is rendered
 * as that reason. A blank table would read as "nothing to report", which is
 * the one thing none of them means.
