"""
The agent loading screen, and the one property that matters about it.

The approved design (`Dump/loading page.png`) draws five specialist layers
around an orchestrator with a signal travelling between whichever two are
talking. That picture is a claim about the system: it says these agents exist,
that this one is working now, and that this one is waiting on it. A claim has
to be true.

This repository has had to delete TWO animated agent pipelines that were not.
The first named a solver the product does not use, with a fabricated runtime
and a verdict no engine had produced. The second, `js/agent-reasoning.js`,
advanced four stages on 450ms timers and filled a progress bar to 100% in front
of a tab change — no request, no wait, no work. The replacement must not be
able to drift back into either, so the tests here are about PROVENANCE rather
than appearance:

  * the view holds no sequence of its own;
  * the recorder holds no sequence of its own either — every step comes from
    the caller that is about to make the request;
  * progress is settled dispatches over planned dispatches, never a timer;
  * the server's own execution trace is what supplies capability names,
    retries and failures;
  * a layer nobody dispatched to is drawn subdued, and stays that way.
