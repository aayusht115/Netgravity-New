# NetGravity — AI Decision Intelligence for Supply Chain & Logistics Networks

NetGravity combines a Next.js decision cockpit with a Python/Flask backend,
deterministic MILP optimization, resilience analysis, governed orchestration,
forecasting, and an Atlas Digital Twin. It can run locally with Python and Node.js
or as a complete Docker Compose stack with Azurite-backed development storage.

> **NetGravity** is a decision-intelligence and network optimization platform for logistics networks. It joins mathematically rigorous Mixed-Integer Linear Programming with a governed AI control plane — and keeps a hard line between the two.

---

## 1. The Core Paradigm

Supply chain tools usually force a choice: solvers that are rigorous but opaque, or AI dashboards that are fluent but unverifiable. NetGravity refuses the trade by making the boundary explicit and enforcing it in code.

**One rule governs the whole system:**

> The MILP, the REI engine and the RF calculator are the only sources of numeric truth. A language model may interpret a request and explain a result. It may never produce, adjust or replace a number.

Three mechanisms enforce that rule rather than merely asserting it:

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| **Read-only evidence** | The reasoning agent receives already-computed results and has no write path back. |
| **Numeric-claim grounding** | Every figure in generated narrative is adjudicated against authoritative values. Contradicted and unsupported numbers are **removed from the text**, not merely flagged. |
| **Proposal validation** | Model-suggested facilities and scenarios are checked against the real network; a hallucinated site fails validation long before the solver runs. |

A fourth principle runs through everything: **missing is not zero.** When exposure, probability or risk cannot be computed, the system reports *why* it could not rather than substituting a value, and missing evidence withholds automation — it can never grant it. Formally: if an action requires evidence `E` to justify running unattended and `E` is `UNAVAILABLE`, `FAILED`, `STALE`, `NOT_COMPUTABLE` or `GROUNDING_FAILED`, `AUTO_ACTION` is prohibited. That says *autonomy cannot be justified*, not *risk is high* — and the two are recorded distinctly. See [`docs/r7_governance_precedence.md`](docs/r7_governance_precedence.md).

## 2. What Is Built

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Deterministic MILP core (multi-echelon, capacitated) | Mature — 100% cost reconciliation, benchmark-anchored |
| Facility Resilience Assessment + Risk Exposure Index (REI) | Complete, cached and persisted |
| Risk Factor (RF) calculation from external event probability | Complete, with explicit refusal semantics |
| Orchestrator control plane (planning, dependencies, governance, audit) | Complete |
| Orchestrator ↔ deterministic core integration | Complete — see [§6](#6-integration-phases) |
| Conversational layer (chatbot → NLU → orchestrator) | Complete — see [§6](#6-integration-phases) |
| Forecasting agent | Complete — per-series forecasts with uncertainty ranges, uploaded-sheet ingestion, and grounded explanations |
| KPI analytics workspace | Complete — network / DC / plant / freight lenses, scoped filters, facility drill-downs, PDF export and on-demand chart explanations |
| Interactive web cockpit | Demonstration build on a synthetic Case-16 fixture |
| Authentication / multi-process persistence | **Not built** — see [§9](#9-known-limitations) |

The mathematics is mature and evidenced. The **system** is not yet deployable — [§9](#9-known-limitations) states exactly what is missing and why passing tests does not settle the question.

## 4. The Deterministic Chain

```
Network Snapshot → Baseline MILP → REI Batch → REI Registry
                                                    ↓
                      External Event Probability P  ↓
                                               ↘    ↓
                                              RF Calculator
                                                    ↓
                                             Risk Assessment
```

### MILP objective

$$\min \sum_{i \in \mathcal{F}} f_i y_i + \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} c_{ijp} x_{ijp} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{D}} h_j \cdot \text{Inv}_j + \sum_{i} \text{closure}_i (1 - y_i) + \lambda_{\text{carbon}} \sum_{(i,j)} e_{ij} x_{ij} + \text{Penalties}$$

Subject to demand satisfaction, facility capacity ceilings, echelon mass balance, SLA thresholds, CapEx budget, contractual closure terms and carbon caps.

> **Solver objective ≠ business cost.** The shortage penalty (default `1e6`/unit) is a mathematical device that forces demand coverage, not a financial cost. Business Network Cost excludes it. Every REI figure is computed on reconciled *business* cost — using the solver objective would let a penalty five orders of magnitude larger than real cost dominate the ranking.

### Validated benchmarks

| Case | Optimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hand-solvable 2-DC reference | **$5,400.00** | Optimal facility `DC_T1`; derived by hand in the fixture docstring |
| Kearney Case 16 synthetic network | **$150,627.70 / month** | 100% cost reconciliation |
| Case 16, closure cost disabled | **$115,638.14 / month** | The pre-V1.4 optimum, retained as a regression anchor |

The $34,989.56 difference is the V1.4 closure-cost term `Σ closure_cost_i · (1 − y_i)`: shutting an EXISTING facility now carries its one-time transition cost, so the optimizer no longer treats closure as free. Both figures are asserted by `smoke_test.py`.

### REI — Risk Exposure Index

$$PI_i = C_i - C_0 \qquad EI_i = \max(0,\ PI_i) \qquad REI_i = \frac{EI_i}{\max_j EI_j} \in [0, 1]$$

Each facility is disrupted in turn and the network re-optimized. `PI` is signed and retained (a negative value flags a facility whose loss *reduces* cost — worth investigating). `EI` floors at zero so REI stays in the domain RF requires. Cost is always the reconciled business cost. **REI is a relative ranking metric**; no absolute severity bands are applied, because none has a documented business basis.

### RF — Risk Factor

$$RF = P + REI - (P \times REI)$$

The probabilistic OR of two independent contributors, with the product term removing the double count. Worked example, asserted by test:

```
P = 0.70   REI = 0.80   ⇒   RF = 0.7 + 0.8 − 0.56 = 0.94
```

**Severity is not probability.** An event can be catastrophic and unlikely, or trivial and near-certain. `severity`, `confidence` and `event_probability` are three independent fields, and only the last may feed RF. When no defensible probability exists, RF reports `NOT_COMPUTABLE` with a reason:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NO_EVENT_PROBABILITY` | No stated probability. Severity was **not** substituted. |
| `NO_REI` | Exposure unavailable or not in the registry. |
| `STALE_REI` | The REI was computed against a different network snapshot. |
| `NODE_MAPPING_UNAVAILABLE` | The event maps to no assessed node. No arbitrary node is chosen. |
| `NO_INPUTS` / `INVALID_INPUT` | Neither available / present but out of range. |

`P = 0` is a **measurement** and computes normally (`RF = REI`). A missing `P` is an **absence** and refuses. The system keeps those different.

## 4b. Conversational Layer

```
USER → CHATBOT → NLU → STRUCTURED INTENT → ORCHESTRATOR → workflow → engines
                        ↑ the LLM stops here
```

The model's influence ends at an `Intent` enum value. It cannot name a workflow, a capability or a step; `WorkflowPlanner` alone maps intent to graph. The `LLMClient` protocol has exactly three members — `available`, `generate`, `stats` — and no tool-invocation mechanism, so there is no path by which a model could reach MILP, REI, RF or governance whatever a prompt instructs.

Three enforcement mechanisms, each structural rather than advisory:

| Mechanism | Prevents |
|---|---|
| `ConversationalIntent` has **no field** able to hold a cost, REI, RF, SLA or governance outcome, and `parameters` rejects result-value key names | A model asserting an authoritative number |
| Every entity id comes from `CanonicalNetwork.facilities`; no code path produces an identifier from user text | A hallucinated facility reaching the solver |
| Language modules are scanned for engine imports by test | A future edit quietly wiring the layers together |

**Ambiguity is decided from the network, not by the model.** Whether "Delhi" is ambiguous is a fact about how many Delhi nodes exist. `"Close Delhi."` asks whether you mean closure, volume shift or capacity reduction; `"close Bangalore DC"` offers the DCs that actually exist. No clarification path runs the solver or creates a scenario.

**Conversation context is inherited only for elliptical follow-ups** ("Why?", "What about Mumbai?"). A message naming its own subject replaces it, and `ChatTurn` has no field capable of carrying a scenario override — so a conversation cannot silently accumulate "Delhi closed AND Mumbai reduced".

**The LLM never decides whether an entity exists.** Every mention is checked against `CanonicalNetwork.facilities`: resolved to a canonical id, reported ambiguous, or refused as unknown. A request naming a site the network does not contain runs nothing — no MILP, no REI, no RF, no governance — for *any* intent, in any capitalisation. Verified by replaying the live model's own wrong answers through the full system: it still calls `"Assess DC_JAIPUR."` a resilience query, and the system still refuses all eight such cases. There is no fuzzy fallback; "Bangalore" never becomes the nearest DC, because a wrong-but-plausible answer is worse than a refusal the user can see.

**The model is consulted for about a quarter of requests, and none that produce a number.** `IntentAgent` calls the gateway only below rule confidence 0.75, and the conversational NLU settles status, forecast and metric queries before the agent is reached. Measured across the 159-case evaluation set: **118/159 decided deterministically, 41/159 reach the model** — and those 41 are malformed input, unknown sites, injections and elliptical follow-ups. Zero scenario, external-event, status, state or explanation requests are classified by a model.

**A model may resolve what the rules could not; it may not overrule what they read plainly.** The intent is the one model output nothing downstream re-derives — an id is checked against master data and a number against the engines, but an intent has no second opinion, and it selects the workflow. So an explicit closure request cannot be relabelled into something milder. See [§6](#6-integration-phases).

```
POST /orchestrator/chat                {"message": "...", "conversation_id": "..."}
GET  /orchestrator/chat/<id>/history
```

## 5. Orchestrator Control Plane

```
RECEIVE → UNDERSTAND → CLASSIFY → PLAN → VALIDATE → EXECUTE
        → COLLECT → CALCULATE → REASON → GOVERN → RESPOND → AUDIT
```

**Workflows are data, not branching code.** Adding one means adding an entry to `WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES`; the orchestrator core is untouched.

| Workflow | Graph |
|---|---|
| `wf_network_state` | load → optimize → kpi → reason → govern |
| `wf_scenario_analysis` | load → baseline ‖ create → validate → solve_scenario → kpi ‖ rei → reason → govern |
| `wf_scenario_comparison` | one isolated create/validate/solve chain per scenario |
| `wf_resilience_query` | load → rei → reason → govern |
| `wf_external_event` | load → interpret_signal ‖ rei → risk → reason → govern |
| `wf_explanation` | load → rei → risk → reason → govern — **no optimization step by construction** |

### Hard vs soft dependencies

A dependency failure does one of two things, and the distinction is declared per edge:

- **HARD** unmet → dependent is `BLOCKED`. It cannot run safely.
- **SOFT** unmet → dependent **runs**, handed explicit `UnavailableEvidence` naming what is missing.

Losing REI must not cost the reasoning and governance that the surviving MILP results still support. A required-step failure outranks any governance verdict at settle time — a verdict about an analysis that did not complete would imply a usable result exists.

### Governance

Rules are evaluated in strict precedence order, most restrictive first, and every rule that fires is recorded.

- **Structural actions are `HUMAN_ONLY` regardless of REI, RF or cost.** This rule is evaluated *before* any threshold, so a low-exposure, low-cost facility closure can never be automated. Irreversibility governs, not exposure.
- Infeasible results authorise nothing.
- **Missing critical evidence withholds automation.** Absent risk information is never read as absence of risk — and never as a reason to act unattended.
- A failed grounding check withholds automation: an explanation that cannot be trusted cannot justify an action.

The evidence rule is **action-aware**, not a blanket override. It asks whether the action would have leaned on risk evidence to justify running unattended; a hypothetical scenario is exempt, because no measurement is load-bearing for something that cannot touch observed state. The rule constrains **autonomy**, never **information delivery**: a report whose exposure analysis failed is still produced and still returned, it simply no longer clears itself for unattended action.

### Digital Twin

Every run publishes its network state to the Digital Twin, through **one** call site in the orchestrator. No engine reaches it and it reaches no engine — `twin/` imports nothing from `optimization`, `resilience`, `costs`, `metrics` or `risk`, and a test asserts that against the compiled source with docstrings stripped. It is handed only frozen result *contracts*, never a `CanonicalNetwork`, so it could not solve anything if it tried.

**Scenarios are deltas, not copies.** A scenario stores only the facilities and lanes that differ from its baseline, plus removals. On a 100-facility network one scenario is **6.5%** of a full state, and ten scenarios cost **5.7%** of copying. Nothing holds a network: states reference `snapshot_id`, and the network stays single-sourced in `SnapshotManager`.

**Absence is a value.** An unassessed facility carries `rei=None`, never `0.0` — on a [0,1] relative scale zero is the value of the *least exposed node in the network*, a specific claim about a node nobody measured. A failed or infeasible run still publishes a state, because showing nothing leaves the previous picture on screen with no sign the run collapsed.

Retrieval is flat with network size — **0.07 ms at 2,000 lanes and at 50,000** — via pagination, aggregate rollups and a summary path that skips lanes entirely.

## 6. Integration Phases

| Phase | Scope | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **V1.4 hardening** | Closure economics, contractual constraints, V1 service methodology, optimization modes, frozen result contracts | Complete |
| **REI V1** | Persistence, caching, invalidation, batch status, parallelism, benchmarks | Complete |
| **Phase 1** | Integrate and validate the deterministic risk core (MILP → REI → P → RF) | Complete — [`docs/facility_resilience_rei.md`](docs/facility_resilience_rei.md) |
| **Phase 2** | Integrate the orchestrator with the real MILP, REI, RF, reasoning, grounding and governance services | Complete — [`docs/phase2_integration.md`](docs/phase2_integration.md) |
| **R7 governance** | Missing critical evidence must never increase action autonomy | Complete — [`docs/r7_governance_precedence.md`](docs/r7_governance_precedence.md) |
| **Phase 3** | Conversational layer: chatbot → NLU → structured intent → orchestrator | Complete — [`docs/phase3_conversational_layer.md`](docs/phase3_conversational_layer.md) |
| **Phase 3.1** | Evaluate and harden the NLU boundary against measured results | Complete, incl. live `gpt-5-mini` evaluation — [`docs/phase3_1_llm_evaluation.md`](docs/phase3_1_llm_evaluation.md) |
| **Phase 3.2** | Deterministic entity validation and conversational context | Complete — [`docs/phase3_2_entity_and_context.md`](docs/phase3_2_entity_and_context.md) |

Phase 2 added **no** new algorithms, agents, risk scores or optimization objectives. It connected what existed and proved the connections hold. The pre-implementation audit is preserved in [`docs/phase2_integration_gap_report.md`](docs/phase2_integration_gap_report.md).

### Defects found and fixed during integration

Recorded because they are the substance of the work, not incidental to it.

1. **Fabricated node status.** The flattened REI projection omitted `calculation_status`, and the RF layer rebuilt a typed registry defaulting every node to `OK` — so an INFEASIBLE node was recorded as healthy in the audit trail. The rebuild was **deleted** rather than patched; the typed registry is now passed through directly.
2. **A facility rename permanently broke RF.** Snapshot ids hash descriptive fields; the REI cache keys on the material fingerprint, which does not. A rename minted a new snapshot id, hit the cache, and returned a batch stamped with the old id — correctly refused as `STALE_REI`, forever. Fixed by re-stamping a cache-served batch at the point where the fingerprint *proves* equivalence, retaining the original in `computed_for_snapshot_id`. **The staleness check was not relaxed**; a material change still misses the cache and recomputes.
3. **Cached batches over-reported solve cost**, contradicting the field's own documented contract. A cache hit now reports `n_milp_solves = 0`.
4. **Shortage priority-multiplier mismatch** (Phase 1): the MILP objective applied a per-demand priority multiplier that extraction and reconciliation did not, opening a 5.36% reconciliation gap. Fixed at both sites; gap now 0.00.

## 8. Testing

```bash
python smoke_test.py                    # 7-check verification (~2s)
pytest -m "not slow"                    # ~1,308 tests, ~220s
pytest                                  # includes large-scale benchmarks
pytest netgravity/tests/integration/    # integration suites only
python scripts/run_nlu_eval.py          # 159-case NLU evaluation, offline, free
```

**1,308 passing, 1 skipped, 0 failing.**

| Suite | Tests |
|---|---|
| `integration/` — Phase 2, R7 governance, Phase 3 conversational, Phase 3.1 NLU, Phase 3.2 entity/context | **588** |
| `test_phase1_risk_chain.py` | 84 |
| `test_orchestrator.py` | 114 |
| `test_orchestrator_hardening.py` | 84 |
| `test_hardening_v14.py` | 69 |
| `test_rei_v1.py` | 65 |
| `test_resilience_rei.py` | 53 |
| MILP core, costs, inventory, service, carbon, scenarios, stress, validation | remainder |

The integration suite exercises the **real** MILP, REI and RF services end to end. Only the LLM gateway and the external signal source are injected doubles — both are boundaries of the system, not parts of it. A test that passed against a faked solver would prove nothing about integration.

### Verified invariants

- The `PHASE2_DELHI` fixture is hand-calculable: `C0 = 1,200`, `PI(Delhi) = 400`, `max EI = 500` ⇒ `REI = 0.80`, and with `P = 0.70`, `RF = 0.94`.
- An 18-case failure matrix: for every component failure, the correct step status, dependency behaviour and evidence state — with **no fabricated zero, no fabricated value, no silent failure and no baseline corruption**.
- Scenario execution never mutates the observed snapshot (asserted byte-for-byte). `ScenarioStore` has no promotion path, and the absence is asserted.
- An explanation query with valid cached evidence performs **0 MILP solves**, measured at the solver rather than self-reported by the cache.
- Concurrent workflows under both `asyncio` and OS threads: distinct execution ids, no evidence crossover, no override leakage, registry consistent.
- A deliberate hallucination (model claims 50% against an authoritative 16.67%) is caught, stripped from the narrative, confidence downgraded, automation withheld.

## 9. Known Limitations

Stated plainly. **NetGravity is not production-ready**, and passing tests is not the same as being deployable.

**Architectural**
- `REPORT` is a single action tier covering both a risk assessment and a routine status summary, so both are treated as evidence-dependent. Separating them needs a new action type. The `actions_requiring_risk_evidence` policy override is the intended escape hatch.
- `CHANGE_CAPACITY` is classified neither structural nor operational, so it falls to the conservative default (R12). Worth an explicit policy decision.
- Location → node mapping is string matching. Adequate when identifiers encode location; a real deployment needs a geographic mapping table.

**Engineering / deployment**
- **No authentication.** Capability-level authorization exists and works, but the actor is caller-asserted.
- Persistence is single-process JSON files. Atomic writes make it crash-safe, not concurrent-writer-safe.
- No in-flight cache deduplication: simultaneous cold REI requests each compute a batch. Redundant work, not divergence.
- Request idempotency returns a point-in-time view to a duplicate racing the original. Sequential retry is fully correct.
- The web cockpit runs on a synthetic Case-16 fixture, not live data.

**Performance**
- Parallel speed-up decays with size (1.98× at 7 facilities → 1.14× at 50). Beyond ~50 facilities a process pool or distributed workers is needed; the `max_workers` / `solve_fn` seams accept either.
- The 100-DC batch figure is a **projection** from three measured single solves, labelled as such in the benchmark rather than reported as a measurement.

**Conversational layer — measured offline over 159 labelled requests** ([`docs/phase3_1_llm_evaluation.md`](docs/phase3_1_llm_evaluation.md))

| Metric | Before Phase 3.1 | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Intent accuracy | 88.7% | **99.3%** |
| Entity accuracy | 98.6% | **100.0%** |
| Probability extraction | 77.8% | **100.0%** |
| Ambiguity detection | 92.2% | **99.3%** |
| Wrong-workflow rate | 11.3% | **0.7%** |
| Adversarial violations | 0 | 0 |

Nine defect classes were found by measurement. The three that mattered: explicitly stated probabilities such as `"0.35 probability of"` and `"15 percent chance"` were **silently dropped**, so a user who had quantified a risk got the same refusal as one who had not; a compromised model could **relabel a closure** as an optimization request, moving the governed verdict from `HUMAN_ONLY` to `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`; and fabricated identifiers like `DC_SHADOW` were **invisible** rather than refused, because `_` is a regex word character so no `\b` falls inside them.

**Live-model evaluation (`gpt-5-mini`, 24 gateway requests, ~$0.13):** intent **84.7%**, entity **91.9%**, probability **100%**, hallucinated entities **0%**, adversarial violations **0**, median latency **2.1 s**. The model is materially worse than the rules on everything the rules already cover, and scores **0/8** on noticing that a named facility does not exist — it invents no ids, it just fails to miss the ones that are absent. Its one win is `rs13`, the pure paraphrase the rules cannot handle, which is exactly the case the LLM tier exists for. Batching is only partly trustworthy (5/8 single-call controls agree), and three of sixteen batches returned unusable output against the 2,000-token response cap.
- Entity resolution is token matching, not semantic. "Our biggest warehouse" resolves to nothing.
- Conversation state is in-memory and bounded (50 turns × 500 conversations); a restart loses history.
- `STATUS_QUERY` answers facility counts by role and nothing wider.
- Injection testing is 18 strings plus the structural invariants, including a deliberately **hostile** model that returns fabricated facilities, asserts `rei: 0.0` / `governance: AUTO_ACTION`, and narrates a fabricated cost. Zero violations. It is not red-teaming; the structural guarantees are the durable protection, not the string list.

**Scope deliberately excluded**
- Lane, supplier and demand-surge REI (REI requires one uniform disruption assumption across compared entities).
- Automatic mitigation and scenario generation.
- Time-to-Recovery modelling. The MILP is multi-period as of Phase 10.9 — flow, demand, capacity and stock are indexed by period — but a TTR experiment also needs a disruption that BEGINS and ENDS within the horizon, and `DisruptionConfig` still expresses only "unavailable for the modelled period". `time_to_recovery_days` therefore still rejects any value rather than pretending. The formulation is no longer the obstacle; the disruption schema is.
- **Forecasting.** There is no demand model and no projection engine. Forecast requests are recognised and declined, because any number produced would be invented rather than computed. Registering a real forecasting capability later needs no change to the conversational layer.

## 10. Quickstart

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayusht115/Netgravity-New.git
cd Netgravity-New
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The backend is available on port `8000`, and the
local Azurite emulator uses port `10000`.

### Run Python and Next.js locally

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+ and Node.js 20.9+.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend-next
npm ci
PYTHON_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5050 npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

### Verification

```bash
python smoke_test.py                    # verify
pytest -m "not slow"                    # broader test suite
```

**Zero-dependency demo:** open `app/standalone/netgravity_standalone.html` directly in a browser.

### Optional: enabling the LLM

The system runs fully offline by default. Without a token the orchestrator uses rule-based intent parsing and template reasoning; **deterministic results are identical either way.**

```bash
export TEXT_API_TOKEN="..."             # server-side secret manager in production
export TEXT_API_URL="..."
export NETGRAVITY_DISABLE_LLM=1         # force offline
```

Credentials are read from the environment only. They are never placed in prompts, URLs, source or logs, and never recorded in the audit trail. The gateway is called from backend code only.
