    # Each line in this table states the same money twice: what it costs a
    # month, and that monthly figure spread over the units handled — rent of
    # 164,667 a month is also "2.63 per unit". Every line used to be charged at
    # its per-unit figure, rent included, and the monthly figures were read and
    # never used. So a network whose only fixed costs were in this table was
    # assembled with a fixed cost of zero at every site: closing a DC saved
    # nothing but freight, and adding capacity cost nothing at all.
    #
    # Charging both halves would be the opposite error — the same rent twice.
    # Each line is therefore classified, from a cost-behaviour column where the
    # table has one and otherwise from its name (`_cost_behaviour`), and counted
    # exactly once:
    #
    #   * a FIXED line is fixed cost at its monthly figure, and its per-unit
    #     figure is not charged;
    #   * a VARIABLE line is charged per unit handled, and its monthly figure is
    #     not charged — it is that rate times some past month's volume;
    #   * a line neither settles is charged per unit, as before, and named in
    #     the notes so the client can classify it.
    #
    # A fixed cost on the FACILITIES sheet is the client's own consolidated
    # figure and wins; the table's fixed lines are then not added to it.

# REMOVED IN PHASE 10.0 — duplicate optimisation engine
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `solve_extracted_network()` lived here: a second, self-contained PuLP MILP
# that solved uploaded networks independently of `netgravity/optimization/milp.py`.
#
# It was removed rather than repaired because it was not a variant of the real
# solver, it was a different model answering a different question with invented
# inputs:
#   * freight cost invented as `max(5.0, dist * 0.02)`;
#   * distance invented as `hypot(dlat, dlng) * 111` (degrees, not road km);
#   * lead time invented as `dist / 600`;
#   * no inventory, carbon, SLA, facility-fixed-cost or shortage terms;
#   * returned `fillRate: 100.0` and `slaAdherence: 96.5` as LITERALS,
#     never computed, and reported `status: "FEASIBLE"` even when the solve
#     was not.
#
# Optimisation is authoritative and singular (brief §5, §10): it belongs to
# `netgravity/optimization/milp.py`, reached through the orchestrator's
# `optimization.solve` capability, on a CanonicalNetwork registered as a
# snapshot. See `app/backend/services/project_registry.py`.
