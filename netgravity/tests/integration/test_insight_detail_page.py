"""
The deep dive: what a finding says, how it was reached, and what to do.

The page had the finding's headline, a chart and a table of figures. What it
did not have was the step between the second and the first — a reader could
see 97.2% and see the conclusion, and had to take the move between them on
trust. The one control that promised to explain it, "Why this finding?", was
a disclosure toggle at the foot that revealed the narrative they had already
read at the top.

Four claims are held here.

  * **The prose is the lede, not a caption.** The narrative was printed in an
    `.insd-chart-note` under the canvas, in the slot this file uses for
    provenance footnotes, so the paragraph explaining the finding was typeset
    as a disclaimer about the picture above it.

  * **The reasoning is on the page.** The engine tags every figure with the
    role it played — the measurement, what it was compared against, the driver
    behind it — and those three lists were concatenated into one flat array
    for a table, throwing the distinction away.

  * **The figures are enumerated once.** Rendered against a real solved
    network, a finding citing one figure printed it four times: in the banner,
    in the chain, in the evidence table and again in the metric tiles.

  * **The call to action is this finding's.** The only buttons were a generic
    "Test a change as a scenario" and "Open in Digital Twin", identical on
    every finding — so a capacity risk whose Overview tile said "Open KPIs"
    arrived here offering the scenario planner.

Asset-level, like `test_overview_and_basemap.py`, and for the same reason:
these are defects in bundled JavaScript, and a browser test would report
"the page looks different" without naming which half had drifted.
