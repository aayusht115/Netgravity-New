NetGravity — Contract / Rate-Card Adapter
==========================================
Reads freight contracts (PDF or text) and produces structured cost rules.

Extracted surcharges do NOT overwrite lane rates — see schemas/contract.py.
They are a separate adjustment layer so the contracted (headline) rate and
the effective rate remain visible side by side, which is the whole point of
the vendor-comparison story.
