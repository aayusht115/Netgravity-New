NetGravity — Content Classification
====================================
Decides WHAT a record set contains, from the data itself.

WHY FROM THE DATA, NOT THE FILENAME
-----------------------------------
Ingestion previously inferred meaning from the path: facilities.csv was
facilities, anything under distributors/ was shipment data. Both assumptions
break on real client files — a workbook called Master_Data_FINAL.xlsx with
five tabs carries five different things, and none of them announce
themselves.

WHY THE ROW DATA AND NOT JUST THE HEADERS
-----------------------------------------
Headers alone are context-blind, which is the same weakness that makes the
static alias table unreliable on its own. A sheet with columns Weight,
Quantity, Date could be a product master or a despatch register; what tells
them apart is that one has a stable row per SKU and the other has a row per
movement with repeating destinations. That pattern only exists in the rows,
so several real rows are always sent, never one.

TWO OPINIONS, AS EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THIS LAYER
----------------------------------------------
    AI       reads columns AND sample rows, so it has context.
    RULES    scores alias-table overlap per content type. Context-blind, but
             perfectly repeatable, free, and available with no API key.

Agreement raises confidence. Disagreement flags for review. With no key
configured the rule scorer runs alone and says so — the same honest-degrade
contract stub mode already follows, never a silent downgrade.

WHAT EACH TYPE MEANS
  FACILITY           master list of warehouses / DCs / plants: one row per site,
                     with capacity or cost attributes
  MARKET             master list of demand zones / delivery destinations
  PRODUCT            SKU master: one row per product, with weight/value attributes
  DEMAND             demand quantities per market and/or product
  LANE               transport links between two locations, with rates or distance
  SHIPMENT_LOG       TRANSACTIONAL despatch/shipment records: one row per movement,
                     typically with a date, a destination that repeats across rows,
                     and a document or vehicle reference
  HISTORICAL_VOLUME  volume measured over time periods, one row per node per period
  MARKET_SIGNAL      dated EXTERNAL intelligence, one row per news item or
                     announcement: a headline, a source, a date, and a stated
                     change (fuel price, freight rate, port notice, duty). It
                     describes the OUTSIDE WORLD, not this network's own
                     facilities, lanes or shipments
  UNKNOWN            genuinely cannot tell, or the sheet mixes several kinds

RULES
- Judge from the ROW DATA, not just the column names. The distinction that
  matters most: a MASTER list has one row per distinct entity, a
  SHIPMENT_LOG/HISTORICAL_VOLUME has many rows repeating the same entities
  over time.
- MARKET_SIGNAL is about events, not entities. If every row names one of
  OUR sites or lanes and carries a rate or capacity for it, that is master
  data, not a signal — however newsworthy the wording.
- Set confidence honestly. If the sheet blends several kinds of data, or the
  sample is too thin to judge, return UNKNOWN with low confidence. A wrong
  confident answer is far worse than an admitted uncertainty.
