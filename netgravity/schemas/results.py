NetGravity — Typed Data Schemas: Results
=========================================
Version: 1.1.0
Structured outputs from the optimization engine.

Every result object is:
  - Fully typed
  - Traceable (carries model_version, scenario_id, solver metadata)
  - Dashboard-ready (structured for direct consumption by API / UI)
  - Independently serializable (JSON-compatible)

No optimization logic is present here — only output structure.

V1.1 Changes:
  - SolverMetadata: best_bound, optimality_label, get_optimality_label()
  - OptimizationResult: result_type, inventory_iterations
  - SensitivityPoint: facility_ids_open, configuration_stable
  - NetworkKPIs: weighted_avg_distance_km, inbound_avg_distance_km,
                 outbound_avg_distance_km, production_cost
