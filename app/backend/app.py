NetGravity — Flask Application
==============================
Serves the frontend and the production API surface.

Run from repository root:
    python run.py
Open in browser: http://localhost:5050/

Phase 10.0 changes
------------------
The prototype entrypoint built ONE process-global orchestrator at import time
from `build_case16_network()` — a fixture annotated in this very file as
"FABRICATED demonstration data" — and every project in the application pointed
at it. Ingested customer networks, though fully assembled by
`netgravity/ingestion/`, were never registered with the engine.

The synthetic network is still loaded, but now as an explicitly-labelled *demo
project* rather than the implicit default that real projects inherit. Real
projects bind their own snapshot after ingestion, via
`app.backend.services.project_registry`, using the orchestrator's existing
`SnapshotManager` — which was always multi-snapshot capable and always honoured
a per-request `network_snapshot_id`.

# `python app/backend/app.py`, which is what someone does when they open the
# file that defines the application — sys.path[0] is THIS directory, and every
# one of those imports raises ModuleNotFoundError. Each is caught by a
# `try/except` that records the reason and carries on, so the server started,
# printed its banner, served the frontend, and answered every API route from
# the static catch-all: `POST /api/auth/login` came back 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED
# with `Allow: GET`, because the only rule that matched it was the one that
# serves files. Nobody could sign in, and the log showed a healthy boot.

# anywhere on the path. `app/backend/` is sys.path[0] when this file is run
# directly, and it contains `app.py`, so `import app` bound to this very
# script: "No module named 'app.backend'; 'app' is not a package". The script
# directory is dropped as well, which is safe because nothing under

# Security Policy: the session token was in `localStorage` precisely because
# nothing stopped injected script from running, and moving it to an httpOnly
# cookie removes the prize without removing the injection. A CSP is what
# addresses the injection itself.
#
# The policy is tight but honest about what this page actually does:
#   * `script-src 'self'` — every module is served from this origin, and there
#     is NO 'unsafe-inline'. That required real work: four libraries were
#     loaded from three third-party CDNs and are now vendored under
#     `frontend/vendor/`, one inline block became `js/landing-bootstrap.js`,
#     and thirty-five inline `onclick` attributes became `data-action`
#     attributes dispatched through an allowlist in `js/actions.js`. Inline
#     handlers cannot be nonced, so none of this was optional.
#   * `'unsafe-eval'` is NOT granted. Nothing here compiles strings.
#   * `img-src` allows `data:` because the India basemap is embedded as a data
#     URI, which is the change that removed the third-party tile CDN.
#   * `connect-src 'self'` — the browser may not send data anywhere else, which
#     is the control that turns an exfiltration into a blocked request.
#   * `frame-ancestors 'none'` — clickjacking, and it supersedes X-Frame-Options
#     in every browser that implements CSP.
