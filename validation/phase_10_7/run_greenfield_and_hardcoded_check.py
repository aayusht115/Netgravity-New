"""Greenfield siting, the loading screen, and values that came from nowhere.

Three questions, all driven through the real application:

  * "Unable to create a scenario where a new facility is opened." The scenario
    was created every time; the new facility could never carry a single unit
    and so was never opened. Two independent causes, both checked here.

  * "The loading screen should load until all the KPIs have been calculated."
    It did not exist on this path: the dashboard appeared first and the figures
    arrived afterwards. The check asserts the screen is never visible with an
    empty model behind it.

  * "Do not keep any hardcoded values." Each check below names a specific
    figure that was on screen and did not come from the user's data.
