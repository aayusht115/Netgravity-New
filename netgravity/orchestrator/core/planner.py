Orchestrator — Workflow planner.

Turns an intent into an explicit dependency graph. Workflows are DATA
(`WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES`), not branching code, so the set of runnable workflows can
grow without the orchestrator core changing.

The planner also decides what NOT to run. A resilience query needs no scenario
solve; a state query needs no REI sweep. Running every engine on every request
would waste solver time and shared LLM budget.

    Record a stated market change as context. No solve, and no scenario.

    WHY THIS WORKFLOW DOES SO LITTLE
        A market signal is evidence, not an instruction. It says diesel moved;
        it does not say what this network should do about it. Turning "diesel
        is up 6%" into a re-optimisation would answer a question nobody asked,
        against inputs nobody changed — every lane rate in the snapshot is
        still the contracted rate, so the solve would return the baseline and
        present it as a response to the news.

        Worse, editing the rates first would be a language model changing a
        number the MILP treats as fact. The architecture's governing rule
        forbids exactly that: the engines are the only sources of numeric
        truth.

        So the signal is loaded against the network (so a reader can see which
        facilities and lanes it plausibly touches), SCORED against the
        guardrail policy, explained, and governed. If it warrants a what-if, a
        person asks for one — and that request arrives as SCENARIO_ANALYSIS,
        with the quantity they chose, through the workflow built to govern
        structural change.

    Note what is ALSO absent: no forecast step. A market signal may legitimately
    inform a forecast, but that happens on the forecast workflow, where
    `ExternalSignalRouter` decides whether the signal is eligible. Wiring
    forecasting in here would let a signal reach the Forecasting Agent by
    virtue of having been mentioned, which is the routing decision the
    orchestrator exists to make.

    "score_signal" is OPTIONAL and SOFT-depended-on by reason/govern, the same
    treatment `interpret_signal` gets in `wf_external_event`: a message with no
    signal to score (or a scoring failure) degrades the narrative, it does not
    fail the run.

    Governance still runs. Every response leaves with a verdict.
