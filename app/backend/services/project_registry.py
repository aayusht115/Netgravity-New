"""
NetGravity — Project Registry & Network Snapshot Binding
========================================================
Closes the single decisive architectural gap found in the Phase 10.0 forensic
audit (P0-1 / P0-2).

Before this module the application layer built ONE process-global orchestrator
at import time from `build_case16_network()` — a fixture the code itself labels
"FABRICATED demonstration data" — and every project pointed at it. Uploaded
customer data, though fully parsed, validated and assembled into a real
`CanonicalNetwork` by `netgravity/ingestion/`, was never handed to the engine.

Nothing new is invented here. The orchestrator already exposes exactly the two
primitives required, and both are already tested:

  * `Orchestrator.register_network(network) -> snapshot_id`
        content-addressed, deep-copied, thread-safe (`state/stores.py:82`)
  * `OrchestratorRequest(network_snapshot_id=...)`
        an explicitly pinned snapshot ALWAYS wins over the current one
        (`execution_context.py:642-646`)

This module is the missing edge between them: it owns `project -> snapshot_id`,
enforces ownership, and refuses to answer analytical questions for a project
that has no network bound rather than borrowing another project's.
