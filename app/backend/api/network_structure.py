"""
NetGravity — Bound Network Structure
====================================
Serves the *structure* of the network bound to a project: its facilities,
markets, products and lanes, exactly as they were registered.

Why this is separate from the KPI endpoints
-------------------------------------------
Structure is INPUT. A facility's id, name, role, coordinates and stated
capacity are things the user uploaded; they are true whether or not a solve
succeeds. Utilisation and throughput are OUTPUT — they only exist once the
MILP has produced flows.

Conflating the two is what made an infeasible network look like an empty one.
`facility_kpis` correctly returns nothing when there is no solved state, and
the Digital Twin read its node list from that endpoint — so a network the
solver could not satisfy rendered as a blank map with no facilities and no
markets, even though the user's eight facilities and seven markets were sitting
in the snapshot the whole time.

This module runs no analysis and computes no KPI. It reads the registered
snapshot and returns it.
