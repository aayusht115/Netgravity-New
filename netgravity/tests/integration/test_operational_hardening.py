"""
The operational claims from the last report, tested rather than asserted.

Each class here covers one item that was listed as "still not true":

  * rate-limit counters were per process, so N workers gave one caller N
    budgets — and the limit loosened by exactly the factor you scaled out by;
  * execution traces lived in a 500-entry ring buffer in memory, so a restart
    kept the answers and lost the workings;
  * a forecast was produced over up to 24 periods and exactly one of them ever
    reached the optimiser;
  * the per-facility KPI endpoint's own docstring promised resilience and risk
    blocks that its workflow never computed.
