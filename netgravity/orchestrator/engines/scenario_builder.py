Orchestrator — Scenario materialisation.

Turns a validated `ScenarioIntentSpec` into a hypothetical `CanonicalNetwork`,
reusing NetGravity's existing `ScenarioEngine` override semantics rather than
reimplementing them.

Isolation is the whole point of this module:

    observed snapshot  --(deep copy)-->  scenario network  --> stored separately

The parent snapshot is never mutated. Two scenarios built from the same parent
share nothing. There is deliberately no path back from a scenario network into
the snapshot store.

    A site's annual fixed cost once its capacity has changed.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    A capacity scenario used to change the ceiling and nothing else, so on the
    model's terms capacity was free. Measured on a complete upload: +20,000
    units at a DC carrying C$38.4M a year left a C$701,441,045.37 network at
    C$701,441,045.37, to the cent. More room can only ever let the solver find
    a plan at least as cheap, so every capacity scenario read as "costs
    nothing, may save something" — which no expansion does.

    THE ASSUMPTION, stated rather than hidden
    ------------------------------------------
    Added capacity costs what the site's existing capacity costs per unit: the
    fixed cost scales pro rata with the new ceiling. That is the linear
    fixed-cost-per-unit-of-capacity reading of a capacitated site, and it is
    the only price the upload itself supports; nothing in it states a separate
    expansion rate.

    A REDUCTION KEEPS ITS COST. Capacity lost to a disruption, a lease still
    being paid, or a line down for maintenance does not hand its fixed cost
    back, so the cheaper reading is not assumed on the client's behalf.

    A site with no fixed cost in the upload stays at zero. The caller reports
    that as unpriced; it is never presented as a price.

        Pin every still-open existing site open, so only the USER closes sites.

        WHY
        ---
        A scenario is solved as `BROWNFIELD_SCENARIO_OPTIMIZATION`, which
        honours facility flags exactly as supplied — and an uploaded network
        supplies `is_closable = True` by default. So the MILP was free to shut
        any site it found cheaper to shut, and it did: a planner who asked
        "what if demand in the west grows 20%?" got back a plan that had also
        closed two DCs they never mentioned. The cost delta they were reading
        was mostly the closures, not the question they asked.

        That is a footprint DECISION, and a footprint decision is something a
        planner makes deliberately — by closing a site in a scenario, or by
        running a greenfield design — not something a what-if quietly performs
        on the way to answering a different question.

        WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
        -------------------
        It only ever sets `is_mandatory` / `is_closable`. In particular:

          * a site the scenario itself closed keeps `is_forced_closed = True`
            and is skipped, so the user's own closure still stands — and still
            pays closure cost, because `baseline_status` is untouched;
          * a CANDIDATE is not pinned. Offering the solver a site is not the
            same as opening one, and forcing a proposed DC open would answer a
            question nobody asked;
          * a site already forced closed in the uploaded data stays closed;
          * a disruption target is never pinned open — an outage is the whole
            point of the run that carries one;
          * markets and customers are never touched: they are demand, not
            footprint.

        Nothing else in the system changes. `GREENFIELD_OPTIMIZATION` still
        releases the footprint through its own mode policy, and this method is
        not on that path — it applies to scenarios, which is where the
        unrequested closures were appearing.
