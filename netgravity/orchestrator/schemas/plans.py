    Outcome of one capability execution, as the orchestrator must read it.

    Defined here, beside `StepStatus` and `EvidenceStatus`, because it belongs to
    the same result layer and `ToolResult` needs it without importing the
    envelope that wraps it. `AgentResult` in `schemas/agent_result.py` re-exports
    it as the public name.

    The distinctions are not cosmetic — each one calls for a different response:

    SUCCESS                Complete, valid, every declared input present.

    PARTIAL                Usable output, knowingly incomplete: some sub-unit
                           failed, or a SOFT dependency was unavailable. The
                           caller may use it PROVIDED it is told what is missing,
                           which is why `unavailable` travels alongside.

    RETRYABLE_FAILURE      Transient. Re-running could succeed. Reported in this
                           phase; retry logic is deliberately not built yet.

    NON_RETRYABLE_FAILURE  Deterministic failure. Re-running produces the same
                           answer, so retrying only wastes solver time and
                           shared model budget. Infeasibility lives here: the
                           solver PROVED there is no solution, which is a real
                           finding rather than a fault.

    INVALID_OUTPUT         It ran and produced something the validators refused.
                           Worse than missing output, because it looks usable.

    INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE  Never attempted, or not computable, because required
                           inputs were absent. Nothing malfunctioned. Kept apart
                           from the failure statuses so a gap in the data is not
                           reported as a broken engine — and, above all, so it

          would produce numbers nobody should trust.

    SOFT  The dependent step can operate on partial inputs. If the upstream step
          fails, the dependent still RUNS and is told, explicitly, that the
          evidence is unavailable.
          Example: REI → reasoning. Losing exposure analysis degrades the
