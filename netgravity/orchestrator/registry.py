"""
Orchestrator — Default capability wiring.

This module is the seam where new agents and engines are plugged in. Adding a
Carbon Optimization Agent, Supplier Risk Agent, Inventory Agent or
Transportation Agent means writing a handler and appending one
`registry.register(Capability(...))` call here — the orchestrator core, planner
and executor are untouched.

Each handler is a small async function that pulls what it needs from the
execution context and delegates to an authoritative engine or agent.
