"""
Orchestrator — Tool interface, retry policy and the capability adapter layer.

Every unit of work the orchestrator can invoke — deterministic engine or
model-backed agent — is a Tool behind one interface. The core executes Tools;
it never imports an engine directly and never lets a model call business logic.

This is the adapter layer the LLM boundary depends on: a model can propose a
capability by name, but the registry decides whether it exists, the validator
decides whether the inputs are legal, and authorization decides whether this
actor may run it.
