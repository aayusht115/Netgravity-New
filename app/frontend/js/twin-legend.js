/**
 * NetGravity — Digital Twin legend, and the encoding it describes
 * ===============================================================
 * One definition of what the twin's corridors LOOK like and what the legend
 * SAYS they look like, so the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * The problem this replaces
 * ------------------------
 * Both views sized a corridor by dividing its flow by a constant — `flow/1500`
 * in the 2D map, `flow/4000` in the 3D twin — and clamping the result. Three
 * consequences, all of them visible on a real upload:
 *
 *   * the two views drew the SAME corridor at different weights, because the
 *     divisors differ by a factor of nearly three;
 *   * the constants suit one network. On a network whose largest corridor
 *     carries 4,500 units — the Case-16 network — every lane in the 2D map
 *     lands under weight 3 and the map is a uniform grey web. On one moving
 *     500,000 units, every lane clamps to the maximum and the map is a
 *     uniform thick web. In both cases the thickness is real but carries no
 *     information, because nothing is distinguishable from anything else;
 *   * and neither view's legend mentioned line weight at all, so a reader
 *     seeing thick and thin lines had nothing telling them what the
 *     difference meant.
 *
 * What this does instead
 * ----------------------
 * Four bands, with boundaries derived from the network's own largest
 * corridor rounded to a 1/2/5 figure. Every lane falls in a band, each band
 * has one weight in the 2D map and one radius in the 3D twin, and the legend
 * prints the same four boundaries. A network of hundreds and a network of
 * hundreds of thousands both get four distinguishable weights, and in both
 * the legend says what they mean.
 *
 * §9 — nothing here is an authoritative figure. The band boundaries are a
 * drawing scale, and the only numbers printed are the boundaries themselves,
 * which the legend labels as such. No lane's flow is restated, rounded or
 * aggregated for display; the tooltip still prints `formatNumber(lane.flow)`.
 *
 * What is NOT in this legend, and why
 * -----------------------------------
 * The mockup carries a "Constrained route" key, drawn as a red dashed line.
 * Nothing in this application knows which corridors are constrained: a lane
 * reaches the browser as `{from, to, cost, distance, leadTime, flow, mode}`
 * (see `integration/mappers/twin-mapper.js`) and carries neither its capacity
 * nor any binding-constraint flag from the solve. A legend entry for it would
 * describe a line the map never draws, and a reader who never saw a red lane
 * would reasonably conclude their network has no constrained routes — which
 * is a finding, and one nothing here established.
 */

/**
 * What each kind of node looks like — the glyph the map draws in it, and the
 * colour it draws it in.
 *
 * THE KEY AND THE MAP HAD THREE PALETTES BETWEEN THEM. The legend keyed a
 * plant in #5b21b6, a DC in #0ea5e9 and a market in #075985; the 2D map drew
 * the same three in #6B2FA0, #2563eb and #0891b2; the 3D twin used a third
 * set. A reader matching a chip against a marker was comparing two different
 * colours, which is the one thing a key must not ask of them.
 *
 * `hex3d` is the same colour as a number, because Three.js materials take one
 * — not a second choice of hue.
 *
 * A DC's colour on the map is the exception, and a deliberate one: its ring
 * (2D) and its body (3D) carry the utilisation band, which the legend's third
 * group keys separately. `color` here is the DC's identity — what its glyph
 * and its fill are drawn in — not its status.

 * How big the glyph inside a node is drawn, from the node's own radius.
 *
 * `radius` on `NODE_STYLE` is the marker's half-width in CSS pixels on the 2D
 * map. It was 16 / 14 / 9, with the glyph rendered at `size - 3` — so a plant
 * was a 13px emoji and a market an 11px one, both below the smallest body
 * text in the product. At the zoom a national network is framed at, a reader
 * could see that a marker was there and could not tell a factory from a shop
 * without hovering it, which is the entire job of a glyph.
 *
 * A FRACTION of the marker rather than an offset from it: a DC's marker grows
 * with its utilisation, and subtracting a constant made the glyph shrink
 * relative to its own circle as the circle grew.
 *
 * RAISED AGAIN, to 19/18/13 at 1.15 — a 22px plant, a 21px DC, a 15px market.
 * The first correction took the glyphs from unreadable to legible-if-you-look;
 * at the zoom a national network is framed at, telling a plant from a shop
 * still meant leaning in. The twin is the whole screen now rather than a
 * 580px band, so the markers have the room — and which KIND of site is where
 * is the thing a reader scans for, which makes it the thing that should be
