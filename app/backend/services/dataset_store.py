"""
NetGravity — Uploaded Dataset Store
===================================
The record of what was uploaded to a project, how it was read, and what was
committed from it. Keyed by `project_id`, written through to the database.

Why this exists
---------------
Two separate failures shared one cause: the upload preview lived in a
process-global dict.

  * **The audit trail was unreachable.** After completing an analysis, opening
    Upload Data showed "Uploaded Files (0)" and "No files uploaded yet" — for a
    solved project. There was no read-only view of the active file, the mapping
    decisions, the quality findings or the ingestion time. A user could not
    verify the data behind a decision, diagnose a mapping error, or safely
    replace a dataset without creating a new project.

  * **The application could not scale past one worker.** `upload-and-parse`
    wrote the parsed structure into memory; `commit` read it back. Under any
    multi-process deployment — gunicorn with two workers, two containers behind
    a load balancer — the two calls land on different processes and the commit
    fails with "there is no parsed upload for this project to commit" on an
    upload that plainly succeeded. It also grew without bound: nothing ever
    evicted a preview.

So the record is durable, and it distinguishes two lifecycle stages that were
previously one blob:

  * a PREVIEW — parsed, not yet analysable, replaced by the next upload;
  * a COMMITTED dataset — bound to a snapshot, and the thing a reader is
    auditing when they ask "what produced this number?".

This module does not parse, map, assemble or solve. It remembers.
