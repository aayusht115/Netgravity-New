Orchestrator — Validation layer.

Everything crossing a trust boundary is validated here: inbound requests,
model-proposed scenarios, and engine outputs.

This is where a hallucinated facility identifier dies. The intent agent may
propose "close DC_ATLANTIS"; the scenario validator checks the real network,
finds no such facility, and fails the run with a clear message — long before
the MILP is invoked.
