"""
Plain-English narration of a derivation, written by the gateway model.

WHY A MODEL IS INVOLVED AT ALL
------------------------------
Everywhere else in this codebase the rule is that a language model may phrase
a result and may never produce one. That rule is unchanged here. What the
model adds is the part the deterministic layer is worst at: joining a table of
figures into an account a reader who was not in the room can follow. A
derivation listing "Average utilisation 56.23%", "Busiest site 77.14%" and
"Utilisation threshold 90%" is complete, and still leaves the reader to work
out for themselves why those three lines add up to the conclusion. That gap is
what makes a correct derivation read as a black box.

THE ONE RULE THAT MAKES IT SAFE
-------------------------------
**A number in the explanation must be a number in the report.**

Not "a plausible number", not "a number the model derived correctly" — one of
the figures already on the page, which the engine computed and the grounding
pass already checked. Everything the model writes is verified against that set
before it reaches the file, and any sentence carrying a figure that is not in
it is dropped. So the worst case for a hallucinated quantity is a missing
sentence, never a fabricated one under a letterhead.

This is a deliberately stricter rule than `numeric_grounding.ground_narrative`,
which adjudicates a claim against whatever metric it names anywhere in the
reasoning payload. That is right for a briefing written from the payload. It is
too loose here, where the report has already narrowed to one finding: a
document restating a run must not reach past the run's own figures for a
number, however true that number is elsewhere.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE GATEWAY IS NOT THERE
------------------------------------------
The document is written anyway, from the deterministic method note. The
gateway's budget is shared and small (100 requests/day across every consumer),
the token may not be configured at all, and a download is something a reader
just asked for. `narrate` therefore raises nothing and blocks nothing: it
returns what it has, and says which it is.
