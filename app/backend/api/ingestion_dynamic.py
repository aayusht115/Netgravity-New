"""
NetGravity — Upload Preview & Mapping-Inspection API Blueprint
==============================================================
Accepts Excel/CSV uploads and returns the ACTUAL columns, sample values, and
measured data-quality metrics so a user can review field mapping before
committing a dataset.

Phase 10.0 rewrite. The prototype version of this blueprint:

  * ran a second, independent MILP on every upload (removed — see
    `network_extractor.py`) and returned its output, which hardcoded
    `fillRate: 100.0` and `slaAdherence: 96.5`, as if solved;
  * reported `validPct: 98.0` and `validRows = total * 0.98` as LITERALS,
    regardless of the data — a fabricated quality claim on real customer files;
  * did `total_rows … or 100`, inventing 100 records for an empty upload;
  * performed no file-type, file-size or file-count validation;
  * stored the parsed network in ONE process-global dict shared by every user
    and every project;
  * leaked a loop variable (`file_mappings`) into its response, so the mapping
    was correct only for single-file uploads.

Scope note: this endpoint is a **preview**. It does not produce an analysable
network. Committing a dataset goes through the real 58-file pipeline at
`/api/ingestions` (parse → detect → map → review → confirm → validate →
canonicalize), whose output is a `CanonicalNetwork` bound to the project by
`app.backend.services.project_registry`. Keeping the two separate is deliberate:
the preview is allowed to be fast and lossy; only the real pipeline may produce
something the solver is permitted to see.
