Orchestrator — Deterministic engine adapters.

Thin async adapters over NetGravity's existing, authoritative engines. They add
NO mathematics: every number comes from `optimization.milp`, `metrics.kpis`,
`metrics.contracts`, `resilience.rei` or `costs.business_cost` exactly as those
modules compute it.

The adapters exist to:
  * present engines behind the uniform Tool/capability interface,
  * flatten engine output into the plain dicts the control plane passes around,
  * run blocking solver work in a thread so independent DAG branches can
    genuinely overlap,
  * translate engine outcomes into the orchestrator's error taxonomy — most
    importantly, mapping solver infeasibility to a NON-retryable outcome.

        permitted, or when even the relaxed model fails.

        What this is
        ------------
        The strict model asks "serve every unit, within every stated service
        level". When that is impossible, the useful next question is not "how
        much shall we make up?" but "serve as much as is physically possible,
        within the same service levels, and tell me exactly what is left
        stranded". That is the model solved here: identical costs, identical
        capacities, identical SLA filtering, with one variable added per demand
        record for the units that cannot be served, priced at
        `config.shortage_penalty`.

        What this is NOT
        ----------------
        It does not relax the client's service levels, invent capacity, or fill
        a gap with an assumed number. The stranded demand comes back as
        `unserved_demand` and depresses `demand_fill_rate`, so a network that
        cannot meet its commitments reports that in its own KPIs instead of
        reporting nothing at all. The shortage penalty is a solver device for
        ranking which demand to strand, not a business cost: it is excluded
        from `business_network_cost` and reported separately as
        `shortage_penalty_cost`.
