"""
The warehouse read: peak against average, ranked, sized, compared.

WHAT THESE PROTECT
------------------
The feature exists because a horizon average cannot answer the question a
multi-period model was built to answer. A DC at 50% for the year and 95% in one
month is comfortable by the average and out of room in March, and every screen
and every briefing in this product read the average. So the properties worth
pinning are the ones that go wrong quietly:

  * the peak and the average are DIFFERENT numbers and both survive to the
    reader (`TestPeakAgainstAverage`);
  * a growth rate is never invented — no default, no zero, no "assume 20%"
    (`TestTheGrowthRateIsAnInput`);
  * absent stock is absent and modelled zero is zero (`TestStockAbsentVsZero`);
  * nothing here re-derives a figure another engine owns
    (`TestItComputesNothingItDoesNotOwn`);
  * the briefing cannot contradict the card above it
    (`TestTheNarrativeReadsThePeak`).

The MILP is real throughout. Nothing here mocks a solve: the whole point is
what the solver's own per-period output means once it is read properly.
