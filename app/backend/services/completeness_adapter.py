"""
The data-completeness check, run against the upload path the product uses.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
There are two ingestion paths in this repository. `netgravity/ingestion/`
is the full pipeline — profiling, AI column mapping, a review console, a
session store — and `netgravity/ingestion/completeness.py` was written
against it, reading `TabularResult.network_rows`.

The product's own upload does not go through it. The browser posts to
`/api/ingestions/preview/upload-and-parse`, which calls
`network_extractor.build_network_from_dataframes()` and hands the result to
`network_assembler`. So the completeness gate — and therefore every
missing-data action item and every missing-data email — would never have
fired for a single real upload.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------------------------
It is an adapter, not a second checker. `check_completeness()` is duck-typed:
it wants an object with `.network_rows` (a dict keyed by ContentType) and
`.staging_rows`. This file builds exactly that from the extractor's own
parsed structure and calls the one existing implementation, so the required
and optional field registries stay in one place. Add a field there and both
paths see it.

The only real work here is the key translation. The extractor names its
columns for the browser (`capacity`, `fixedCost`, `slaDays`); the registry
names them for the engine (`capacity_units_per_period`,
`fixed_cost_per_year`, `sla_days`). The map below is that correspondence,
written out once, explicitly — never inferred by string-munging, which is
how `fixedCost` and `fixed_cost_per_year` would quietly stop matching the
day either side is renamed.

WHAT ABSENCE MEANS HERE
-----------------------
The extractor has already read the workbook, and it writes `None` for a
column it did not find (deliberately — see its `capacity` note: "treated as
uncapacitated rather than given a default size"). So `None` here still
means "the client never sent this", which is the distinction the whole
check rests on. What is NOT distinguishable at this point is a client who
sent a genuine zero: the extractor's `_num()` returns 0.0 for that, and the
check reads it as present. That is the correct reading — a stated zero is
data — and it is why this runs on the extractor's output rather than on the
`CanonicalNetwork`, where an absent field and a defaulted one look alike.
