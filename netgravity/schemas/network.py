"""
NetGravity — Typed Data Schemas: Network Entities
==================================================
Version: 1.1.0
All supply-chain network entities with full Pydantic validation.

Every parameter carries:
  - value (the quantity itself)
  - unit  (physical unit string, documented in field description)
  - source (optional provenance)
  - confidence (optional: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)

This module defines the canonical data contract.
The optimizer, scenario engine, and metric engine all consume these types.

No UI, LLM, or dashboard logic is present here.

V1.1 Changes:
  - Added DEPOT, CUSTOMER to NodeRole
  - FacilityRecord: production_capacity_units_per_period, opening_cost,
    ramp_up_cost, is_forced_closed, is_existing/is_candidate properties
  - LaneRecord: distance_method, network_distance_km
  - OptimizationConfig: minimum_throughput_enabled, days_per_period,
    emission_methodology, emission_factor_table,
    inventory_max_iterations, inventory_convergence_tolerance
  - Model version bumped to 1.1.0

    Contractual state of a facility for the modelled planning period.

    Deliberately minimal: this is the smallest state set needed for realistic
    brownfield closure decisions, not a contract-management system. No contract
    rule is ever inferred — every state comes from input data or an explicit
    scenario override.

    NONE     No contractual commitment recorded. Default. The facility is
             subject to normal optimization constraints.
    ACTIVE   A contractual commitment is in force for the modelled planning
             period. Combined with `contract_allows_early_closure` this yields
             the two active states:
               - allows_early_closure = False → facility MUST remain open
                 (MILP constraint C5c pins y_i = 1)

                 configured `closure_cost` is charged as the early-termination

    EXPIRED  A contract existed but has expired for the modelled planning

class OptimizationMode(str, Enum):
    """
    What decision the optimizer is being asked to make.

    All five modes use the SAME MILP formulation. A mode never changes the
    mathematics; it only fixes decision variables and selects which economic
    terms apply, centralised in `optimization/modes.py`.

    ACTUAL_AS_IS_EVALUATION
        Evaluate the observed network without redesigning it. Existing
        facilities are pinned open, candidates are excluded, and only lanes
        flagged `is_active_baseline` are available. This is the comparison
        anchor for business performance and resilience.

        LIMITATION: NetGravity V1 has no observed-flow input field, so this
        mode evaluates the observed FOOTPRINT and LANE SET with a cost-minimal
        feasible allocation. It does not replay recorded shipment volumes.

    CURRENT_FOOTPRINT_OPTIMIZATION
        Optimize routing and allocation while the facility footprint stays
        fixed. Existing facilities remain open, candidates are excluded, and
        open/close decisions are locked — but every lane is available, so flow
        may re-route. No closure decision is possible, so no closure cost.

    GREENFIELD_OPTIMIZATION
        Optimize the footprint from candidate locations, releasing the existing
        footprint. Closure cost does NOT apply: a facility being absent from a
        greenfield design is not a decision to close it. This remains
        CANDIDATE-LOCATION optimization — NetGravity does not perform arbitrary
        continuous geographic siting.

    BROWNFIELD_SCENARIO_OPTIMIZATION  (default)
        Optimize a modified existing network. Facility flags are honoured
        exactly as supplied, so explicit scenario overrides drive the result.
        Closure economics and contractual constraints both apply. This is the
        default because it reproduces NetGravity's pre-existing behaviour
        exactly — selecting it transforms nothing.

    DISRUPTION_RESILIENCE_OPTIMIZATION
        Re-optimize after an explicit disruption override. Behaves like
        BROWNFIELD except that facilities marked `is_disruption_target` are
        exempt from closure cost and from contractual must-remain-open
        constraints: an involuntary outage is not a voluntary closure decision.
