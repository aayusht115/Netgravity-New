NetGravity — Ingestion Configuration
=====================================
Single source of truth for every path, mode and credential the ingestion
pipeline needs. Nothing in the ingestion package may construct a filesystem
path or read an environment variable directly — it all comes from here.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR AZURE
--------------------------
When this pipeline moves to Azure, no ingestion code changes. Only the
environment variables below change:

    NETGRAVITY_STORAGE_BACKEND   local  ->  azure_blob
    NETGRAVITY_DATA_ROOT         ./data ->  (unused; container names apply)
    NETGRAVITY_LLM_API_KEY       .env   ->  Azure Key Vault secret reference

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
    NETGRAVITY_DATA_ROOT          Root folder for data zones (default: <repo>/data)
    NETGRAVITY_STORAGE_BACKEND    "local" | "azure_blob"   (default: local)
    NETGRAVITY_AZURE_CONN_STR     Azure Blob connection string (azure_blob only)
    NETGRAVITY_USE_CLAUDE         THE switch — the only one. Unset/false =>
                                  OpenAI (default). "true" => Anthropic Claude.
    NETGRAVITY_LLM_API_KEY        Generic key, used for whichever provider is
                                  active. If ABSENT, the AI client runs in
                                  STUB MODE and returns canned responses so
                                  the pipeline still runs.
    NETGRAVITY_OPENAI_API_KEY     Per-provider keys. Optional, and preferred
    NETGRAVITY_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  over the generic one when set: keeping both
                                  in .env means flipping NETGRAVITY_USE_CLAUDE
                                  switches vendor with no other edit.
    NETGRAVITY_LLM_MODEL          Model identifier. Blank => a per-provider
                                  default from DEFAULT_MODELS below, so the
                                  model always follows the switch.
    NETGRAVITY_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS  Per-request timeout (default 60).
    NETGRAVITY_LLM_MAX_RETRIES    Transient-error retries, handled by the
                                  vendor SDK (default 3).
    NETGRAVITY_LLM_STRICT         "true" => a failed live call FAILS the run.
                                  Default false => degrade to stub data, which
                                  is then labelled "[AI: FAILED -> STUB DATA]"
                                  in the report. Set true for any run whose
                                  numbers someone might act on.
    NETGRAVITY_LLM_BASE_URL       Optional. Points the OpenAI SDK at a
                                  different server instead of api.openai.com.
                                  Several providers speak the identical API
                                  ("OpenAI-compatible") — OpenRouter, Groq,
                                  Cerebras, GitHub Models — so this is the one
                                  setting that lets us use a free/alternate
                                  provider with ZERO other code changes. Put
                                  that provider's key in
                                  NETGRAVITY_OPENAI_API_KEY and its model name
                                  in NETGRAVITY_LLM_MODEL. Blank => real
                                  OpenAI, unchanged.
