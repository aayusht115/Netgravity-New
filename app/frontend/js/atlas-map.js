/**
 * The ground the network is drawn on.
 *
 * Two things were wrong with what this replaces.
 *
 * It began as an unconditional tile request to
 * `https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/...` — a third-party service on
 * an anonymous quota. When that quota or a corporate network refuses, the
 * service does not return an error: it returns a perfectly valid PNG with
 * "API key required" printed across it. HTTP 200, decodes cleanly, no
 * `tileerror` for Leaflet to catch. The client's own facilities were then
 * plotted on top of a watermark announcing that their software was
 * misconfigured, and nothing in the application could tell.
 *
 * The fix for that was `INDIA_BASEMAP_DATA_URI`, a raster photograph of India
 * embedded in the application. It needed no key and no internet — but it is a
 * photograph of ONE COUNTRY, cropped to 4-39N / 65-100E. A network anywhere
 * else got a bare 10-degree graticule: a US network's twelve facilities on an
 * empty grid, correct coordinates, no land.
 *
 * Now the land is vector. `WORLD_COUNTRIES` is Natural Earth 110m — 177
 * countries, public domain, bundled, ~180 KB — drawn as GeoJSON polygons by
 * Leaflet's own renderer. It needs no key, no quota and no connection; it
 * covers every network anywhere; it stays sharp at any zoom instead of
 * pixelating past zoom 8; and, because the 3D twin builds its ground plane
 * from the SAME rings, the two views cannot drift apart.

 * comparing its scenario volume against the same lane in the baseline.
 *
 * This function used to be a switch over five prototype scenario ids
 * (`SCN_REBALANCE`, `SCN_USER_1`, …), each branch assigning literal
 * utilisation and throughput to `DC_DELHI`, `DC_MUMBAI`, `DC_BENGALURU`,
 * `DC_KOLKATA` and `DC_GUWAHATI`, with hand-written flow overrides on
 * `PLT_BADDI → DC_DELHI` and a `deltaText` describing a rebalancing no solver
 * had performed. A user-created scenario matched none of those branches and
 * fell into an `else` that invented `DC_DELHI` at `delhiUtil || 88.0` and four
 * more facilities beside it — none of which exist in an uploaded network, so
 * the override map addressed nothing and every scenario rendered the baseline.
 *
 * Returns empty collections when the scenario carries no solved state, so the
 * map draws the network without overrides rather than inventing them.
