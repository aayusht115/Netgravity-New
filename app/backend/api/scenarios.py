"""
NetGravity — Scenario Planning & Simulation API Blueprint
=========================================================
Project-scoped what-if scenarios, solved by the real MILP engine through the
orchestrator and reported through the Phase 9.1 authoritative KPI layer.

Phase 10.0 rewrite. The prototype version of this blueprint:

  * shipped two fully hardcoded "canonical" scenarios, complete with fabricated
    cost/SLA/carbon figures, fabricated robustness tests all marked PASS, and a
    fabricated `aiAssessment` narrative;
  * on `/simulate`, ran a REAL orchestrator solve, obtained REAL
    `ScenarioMetricDelta` objects — and then discarded them, returning
    `totalCost: 1205000`, `sla_val = 95.5`, `avgUtil: 68.2`, `carbonKg: 102400`
    as literals, with a fabricated `-6.5` fallback for the one delta it did read;
  * stored every user's scenarios in one process-global list.

Every figure returned by this module now originates in `KPIRegistry` and carries
its `KPIStatus`. Where a value cannot be computed, the status says so and the
value is null — never a plausible substitute (brief §9, §24).

    Which sites this plan fills, empties and leaves closed — for a record of

    `_capacity_response` computes this at simulate time and writes it onto the
    record, and every rung in `_recommended_actions` is gated on it. A scenario
    stored before it existed carries no such block, so `cap` was `{}` and the
    ladder could see nothing: measured on the demo project, all three saved
    scenarios return `capacity_response: ABSENT`, one of them a +30% demand run
    with a site sitting at 100% of capacity — and the card recommended nothing
    about capacity, because the only rung that could still fire reads the
    scenario REQUEST rather than the account.

    `/compare` recomputes the recommendations against the stored record, which
    was meant to cover exactly this. Recomputing a ladder over a block that is
    not there recovers nothing.

    So the account is rebuilt from what the record does carry:
    `scenario_facilities` and `baseline_facilities` are the same authoritative
    per-site figures `_capacity_response` reads, and the thresholds are the same
    three constants.

    TWO THINGS ARE NOT RECOVERED, deliberately:

      * site NAMES live on the engine's facility metadata rather than on the

        the same sentence with the site's real name and far better than no
        recommendation at all;
      * `regions_without_room` stays empty. A region cannot be declared full
        without knowing which sites are in it, and the record does not say. A
        record of this age can therefore be recommended an expansion, a
        reopening or a consolidation — never a new site somewhere the data

    What this plan asks of the existing sites, and where it runs out of them.

    The question a demand scenario is actually asking. The recommendation card
    answered it with the network's cost narration, which is the same answer it
    gives every scenario; this is the part that differs between raising demand
    by 5% and raising it by 50%.

    Four facts, each read from authoritative per-facility values:

      * `at_ceiling`   — sites the plan fills completely. These are where more
                         capacity has to come from if anything is to change.
      * `working_harder` — sites carrying materially more than they did, with
                         room still on them. The utilisation a planner has to
                         actually achieve.
      * `idle`         — capacity the plan left closed. Reopening is cheaper
                         than building, so it is named before any new site is.
      * `regions_without_room` — regions whose every site is at its ceiling and
                         which have nothing closed left to reopen. Only these
                         can honestly be called places a new site is needed,
                         and only on an upload that states regions at all.

    not an invented one.

                               (a plant's handling capacity above its
                               production limit), so nothing usable was added
                               and nothing is charged;
