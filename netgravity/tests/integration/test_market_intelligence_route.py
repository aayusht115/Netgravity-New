"""
Market intelligence through the orchestrator — the chat route and the
document route, and the boundary that keeps both away from the risk chain.

EVERY TEST HERE RUNS OFFLINE. `allow_llm=False` and stub-mode config are set
explicitly, so this file behaves the same with or without credentials in the
environment.

The recurring subject is one distinction: a market change has a MAGNITUDE and
has already happened; a hazard has a PROBABILITY and might. Confusing them in
either direction is a correctness failure, not a taxonomy quibble —
`RF = P + REI - P*REI` is computed from a probability, and governance is
decided from RF.
