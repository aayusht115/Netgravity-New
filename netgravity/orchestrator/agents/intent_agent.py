"""
Orchestrator — Intent interpretation.

Turns natural language into a structured, validated `IntentResolution`.

Two-tier by design:

  1. **Rule-based parser** — always runs. Deterministic, free, offline, and
     sufficient for the common phrasings.
  2. **LLM interpretation** — used only when the rules are not confident and a
     gateway is configured. Shared gateway capacity is small, so a model call
     must earn its place.

Whatever the source, the output is only a PROPOSAL. Facility identifiers are
re-validated against the real network before any engine runs, so a hallucinated
site name fails validation rather than reaching the MILP.
