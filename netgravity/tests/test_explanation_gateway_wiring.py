"""
The model connection for explanations: one gateway, one credential.

THE CREDENTIAL IS THE SWITCH. `TEXT_API_TOKEN` blank means every explanation
is written by the deterministic template; set means written by the model.
There is no separate on/off flag, because two settings answering one question
eventually disagree — and a token present with a flag off looks exactly like
a token that is missing.

The defect these tests exist for: the forecast and comparison flows built a
bare `ReasoningAgent()`, which holds no gateway, so they produced templates
however anything was configured — while the status said AI was enabled.

Nothing here makes a real request. The transport is faked at `requests.post`.
