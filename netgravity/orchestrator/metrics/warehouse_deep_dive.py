"""
NetGravity — Warehouse health, growth sizing and deep-dive rankings
===================================================================
Peak versus average, ranked, and sized against a stated growth assumption.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
The authoritative layer already answers "how utilised is this site?". It could
not answer the four questions a network planner actually opens a warehouse
review to ask:

  * Is this site tight ON AVERAGE or tight IN ITS WORST PERIOD? A DC at 43%
    for the year and 91% in March is at 43% by the average and out of room in
    March, and only one of those two numbers decides whether the footprint
    works.
  * WHERE do I look first? Twenty facilities and one utilisation column is a
    table, not a finding.
  * What would this footprint need if demand grew at the rate I am planning
    against?
  * What did optimising actually change, site by site?

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
Not a second KPI engine, and it owns no arithmetic that another module owns.

  * Utilisation — average AND peak — is read verbatim from `FacilitySummary`.
    The MILP computes both; this module re-derives neither, so a ranking here
    can never disagree with the utilisation on the facility screen.
  * Cost per facility is the engine's own attribution (`total_facility_cost`),
    carried across the contract bridge unchanged.
  * Inventory is the sum of the I_{i,k,t} decisions the solve produced.

What it DOES compute is the reading over those figures: max and mean over the
periods, counts against a configured threshold, ordering, subtraction between
two solved states, and one explicit multiplication by a growth rate the caller
states. Each is named at its site below.

THE GROWTH RATE IS AN INPUT, NEVER A DEFAULT
--------------------------------------------
`future_requirements` needs a rate of demand growth, and there is no honest
default for one. A hardcoded +20% would put a sized capacity gap, in units, on
a screen — an authoritative-looking number resting on an assumption nobody
made. So the caller states the rate and where it came from, and with no
assumption the section reports INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE and says what it needs,
rather than returning rows built on a guess.
