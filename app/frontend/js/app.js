           site. Captioning it "Network-wide" did not fix that: a reader
           scanning six cards about Atlanta reads the fifth as Atlanta's too.

           Service level is a property of demand, not of a building, and this
           model does not decompose it per site — so this is not a figure
           waiting to be built, it is one that does not exist at this level.

             nothing ever fills — over two hardcoded "Not reported" strings.
             So Columbus Regional DC read "Not reported" three times while the
             health table two panels away reported 415 average and 2,117 peak
             units for that same site: one screen, two answers to "does this
             site hold stock".
             Days of coverage is NOT computed here and is not implied. It
             needs a demand rate and a period length in days, and the solve
             states neither — so the card reports the quantity the solve did
             produce, and the coverage line says what is missing rather than
             printing a number nobody measured.
             A measured 0 stays 0: a site holding none is not a site nobody

   OVERVIEW — row 2: the three findings that need a decision
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Three tiles, side by side, each saying the same four things in the same
   order (Nielsen #4 — consistency):

     1. the conclusion, in bold, with the figure it turns on;
     2. why it matters, in figures the engine reported;
     3. what to do about it, with a button that goes there;
     4. the way into the full finding.

   This replaces a single scrolling "Needs your attention" card. That card
   gave the lead finding a heading, a "why it matters" block, an "impact"
   block, a recommended change, a recommended next step and a collapsed list
   of everything else — six sections in a 500px column with an internal
   scroller, so on a 1050px window 204px of it, including the recommendation,
   sat below its own bottom edge. Three tiles put three findings on one screen
   with nothing hidden, and the rest are on the Insights page.

   COLOUR IS CARRIED BY ONE TILE. Only a RISK is tinted. A palette applied to
   every tile distinguishes nothing, and a green "opportunity" beside a red
   "unserved demand" invites a reader to weigh them against each other as two
   sides of one choice — which they are not.

 *   2. THE THIRD TILE IS WHERE THE MONEY GOES. The total network cost is the
 *      first figure in the KPI strip above these tiles, and a tile restating
 *      it said nothing new. The cost-structure finding names the largest cost
 *      line and how to cut it, which is the cost question a leader can act on.

   OVERVIEW — row 3: what the analysis did not have
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   The completeness gate reads the upload and reports the fields that are not
   in it. Two kinds, and they must never read as one:

     REQUIRED  a field the analysis needs. Its absence is why some figure on
               this page is a dash.
     OPTIONAL  a field that would sharpen the analysis. Its absence costs
               precision, not the result.

   Both used to be buried inside the attention card's collapsed "further
   findings" list, seventh to tenth on a real upload — below the fold, inside
   a card that scrolled. A request nobody scrolls to has not been raised.

   EVERY REQUEST, AND THE FULL WIDTH.

   This showed two per group with an "N more" link into the Insights page.
   Two is the wrong number for a list whose whole purpose is to be actioned:
   a reader cannot tell whether the third one matters without opening another
   screen, and the count that replaced them ("3 more optional fields") is a
   statistic rather than something anyone can act on. All of them are here.

   And each group is one band across the page rather than a column beside its
   neighbour. Two side-by-side cards are only ever the same height by
   accident — with two required fields and three optional ones, the shorter
   one ends in a block of empty tint. A full-width band ends where its last
   request ends.
