"""
Orchestrator — The KPI Registry.

One access layer over metrics that already live in five different typed,
authoritative results: `NetworkStateResult` (MILP), `FacilityResilienceRegistry`
(REI), `RiskAssessment` (RF), `ForecastResult` (forecasting), and the Digital
Twin's own comparison machinery. Every method below either:

  1. WRAPS a value that already exists in one of those results, unchanged, or
  2. performs a DERIVED calculation using only already-authoritative inputs,
     each one documented at its call site with why it counts as "legitimate"
     rather than a new formula.

Nothing here recomputes a cost, a fill rate, an REI, an RF or a forecast. The
specialist engines listed in `docs/authoritative_kpi_architecture.md` §4 keep
sole ownership of their own arithmetic.
