# NetGravity — Data Ingestion Business Rules

**Audience:** anyone who needs to answer "why did the system do that?" without reading Python.
**Scope:** `netgravity/ingestion/` only. The optimisation engine's own rules are in `docs/mathematical_model.md`.
**Status:** guardrail thresholds are PROPOSED and awaiting team confirmation. Everything else is implemented and tested.

---

## 1. The one principle everything follows

> **Deterministic logic calculates. AI reads, maps and explains. AI never produces a number that reaches the optimizer.**

The model infers that a column called `Wt (kgs)` means kilograms and proposes a conversion factor. The multiplication itself is plain Python. The model reads a contract clause saying "add Rs. 5.00 per kg" and extracts `5.0`. The addition is plain Python.

This is testable, not aspirational — see §8.

---

## 2. Row-level validation rules

Two severities, and the distinction carries real weight:

| Severity | Meaning | Effect on the row |
|---|---|---|
| **ERROR** | The row cannot be used | Dropped from the network |
| **WARNING** | Suspicious, or repaired | **Kept**, and reported |

### Why we prefer repairing over rejecting

Dropping a row is not the safe default. If a demand row is dropped, that market vanishes from the network and the optimizer returns a confident, clean "OPTIMAL" answer **to the wrong problem**. A wrong answer that looks right is more dangerous than a loud warning.

So the rule is: **reject only what cannot be interpreted at all; repair anything whose intent is unambiguous, and say so loudly.**

### The rules

| Code | Rule | Severity | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-001 | Required field missing or blank | ERROR | Cannot construct the record |
| R-002 | Value is not numeric | ERROR | Cannot be interpreted |
| R-003 | Negative value where only ≥ 0 is meaningful | ERROR | Negative cost/capacity/demand is not a real quantity |
| R-004 | Latitude/longitude outside global valid range | ERROR | Physically impossible |
| R-004 | Coordinates outside the configured geography | WARNING | Probably wrong, but the network may have expanded |
| R-005 | Unknown enum value (role, status, mode) | ERROR | Not a category the model understands |
| R-006 | Referenced ID does not exist | ERROR | A lane to a non-existent market cannot be solved |
| R-007 | Duplicate primary key | ERROR | Ambiguous which record is authoritative |
| R-008 | Origin and destination are the same node | ERROR | Not a transport lane |
| R-008 | Distance beyond plausible domestic range | WARNING | Likely a unit error; may be legitimate |
| R-008 | Zero transit time on a lane over 200 km | WARNING | **Would make every SLA constraint pass automatically** |
| R-009 | `service_level` in (1, 100] | WARNING — **repaired** | `95` unambiguously means 95%; divide by 100 |
| R-009 | `service_level` above 100 | ERROR | No sensible reading |
| R-011 | Observed throughput exceeds stated capacity | WARNING | One of the two figures is wrong; we cannot tell which |
| R-013 | File unreadable / unsupported type | WARNING | Skip the file, continue the run |
| R-014 | Contract contains a conditional surcharge | WARNING | The headline rate understates true cost — see §5 |
| R-015 | Low-confidence contract extraction | WARNING | Verify against the source document |
| R-016 | Unit conversion could not be applied | WARNING | Value kept unconverted; needs review |
| R-017 | AI column mapping below 90% confidence | WARNING | Needs human confirmation before being trusted |
| R-018 | Column could not be mapped | INFO | Dropped rather than guessed |
| R-019 | Zone-sheet demand with several products and no `Product_ID` | ERROR | Splitting a zone total across products would be a guess that changes the optimum |
| R-020 | A per-period column names its period (`Daily_Demand_Units`, `Monthly_Capacity`) | INFO | Converted to MONTH; the factor is recorded |
| R-021 | Demand exceeds capacity by roughly 30× / 12× / 7× | ERROR | Almost certainly a period mismatch, not a real shortfall — solving would report a **false INFEASIBLE** |
| R-021 | Demand exceeds capacity by some other ratio | WARNING | May be a genuine shortfall; worth confirming the periods match |
| R-022 | `Capacity_Per_Trip` without `Transit_Frequency` | WARNING | Lane left uncapacitated — a wrong cap invents a constraint, no cap merely loses one |
| R-024 | A file or sheet could not be read at all | WARNING | Reported and skipped; the rest of the run continues |
| R-025 | A column mapping is awaiting human confirmation | INFO | The column is NOT applied until confirmed — see §11 |
| R-026 | A record set could not be classified | WARNING | Held for a human to label rather than routed on a guess |
| R-027 | PDF text was unusable, or was used despite failing the quality checks | WARNING | Either the file was rejected, or its figures are LOW confidence — see §10 |
| R-028 | A market-intelligence file is not a document type this adapter reads | WARNING | Rejected before any model call; the message names the route that would work |
| R-029 | A candidate market signal was read but not ingested | WARNING | Most often no stated publication date — see §15 |

### Time periods — everything lands on MONTH

The engine works in months (`OptimizationConfig.cost_period` defaults to
`MONTH`, `days_per_period` to 30). Every per-period quantity is converted on
the way in, using the period stated in the **client's own column name**:

| Column says | Example | Treated as |
|---|---|---|
| a period | `Daily_Demand_Units`, `Monthly_Capacity` | converted to MONTH (×30, ×1) |
| nothing | `Capacity_Units`, `quantity` | assumed already MONTH |

Two details that are easy to get wrong:

- **Standard deviation is read from its own column**, not inherited from the
  quantity column. The workbook mixes periods on one sheet — `Daily_Demand_Units`
  sits beside a `Demand_Variability` example of "200 units/month". Inheriting
  would inflate variability ~5.5× and, through safety stock, inventory cost.
  Where variability genuinely is daily, it scales by √30, not 30.
- **Period-qualified names still resolve.** `Monthly_Capacity_Units` matches
  `Capacity_Units`; the period word is stripped for matching. Without this,
  stating the period explicitly would make a column silently unrecognised.

Because `Capacity_Units` states no period, R-021 exists as a numerical backstop:
demand exceeding capacity by close to 30× is treated as a unit error rather than
a real shortfall.

### Tolerances (deliberate)

Values like `Rs.1,20,000`, `₹4,200` and `1,20,000` are parsed correctly. Human-maintained spreadsheets contain currency symbols and thousands separators, and rejecting them would generate noise rather than insight.

---

## 3. What happens to a flagged item

1. It appears in the run summary count (`⚠ 3 flagged`)
2. It is listed individually with **file name, row number and column**, so it can be corrected at source
3. **The row still flows into the network** — flagging never silently removes data
4. For AI mappings, the model's own reasoning is printed alongside

There is currently **no UI**. All output is terminal text. The report is a structured object (`IngestionReport`) designed so a future screen can render the same information, but that screen does not exist yet.

---

## 4. AI column mapping (distributor files)

### The problem
Every distributor sends a different spreadsheet shape — different headers, different order, different units, dates in whatever format their ERP exports.

### The rules

| Rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Confidence ≥ 0.90 | Accepted automatically |
| Confidence < 0.90 | Flagged (R-017) for human confirmation |
| Column not confidently mappable | Left **unmapped and dropped** (R-018), never guessed |
| Target field not in the canonical schema | Rejected outright — the model cannot invent fields |
| Unit conversion | Model proposes the factor; **arithmetic is deterministic code** |

### The confirmation loop (human-in-the-loop)

```bash
python -m netgravity.ingestion --list-mappings              # review what was proposed
python -m netgravity.ingestion --confirm-mapping <id>       # a human approves
```

Once confirmed, the mapping is cached and **every later file from that distributor skips the AI call entirely**. The AI cost is paid once per FORMAT, not once per file.

### Known limitation

Confidence is **self-reported by the model**, not statistically calibrated. It is a useful triage signal for routing work to a human — it is not a probability. Treat 0.90 as a review threshold, not a correctness guarantee.

---

## 5. Contract extraction

### The business case
Vendor A quotes Rs.10/kg. Vendor B quotes Rs.12/kg. A looks cheaper — until a clause in an annexure adds Rs.5/kg for "non-serviceable locations", which are exactly the remote destinations that matter.

### The rules

| Rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Surcharge with **no** location list | Blanket — applies to every lane |
| Surcharge **with** a location list | Conditional — applies only where named |
| Any conditional surcharge present | Contract flagged `has_hidden_cost` → R-014 warning |
| Contracted rate | **Never overwritten** |
| Effective rate | Computed separately, at assembly time |

### Why the rate is never overwritten

Both numbers must stay visible. Overwriting the base rate would hide precisely the thing we are trying to surface.

### Worked example (from the shipped sample data)

| Destination | TransCorp (Rs.10 headline) | SpeedFreight (Rs.12 flat) | Cheaper |
|---|---|---|---|
| MKT_DELHI | 10 + 2 fuel = **12** | **12** | tie |
| MKT_GUWAHATI | 10 + 2 fuel + 5 NSL = **17** | **12** | **SpeedFreight** |

The lower headline rate is 42% more expensive at an NSL destination.

---

## 6. External signal guardrails

### The problem
External news can improve a forecast — or fill it with noise. The team's direction: *"Competitor news is low value. Carriers, logistics providers and suppliers are what actually move cost and service."*

### How a signal is classified
By **keyword matching** against trigger lists in `netgravity/ingestion/guardrails/thresholds.yaml`. This is deliberately deterministic, not model-driven: the guardrail is what protects the optimizer, so its decisions must be reproducible and reviewable.

### How a signal is scored

```
score = base_relevance (by bucket)
      + 0.25  if it names a facility/market we actually operate
      + 0.15 / +0.05 / −0.10   for HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW source confidence
      + 0.20  if it clears the materiality bar

passes if score >= that bucket's threshold
```

### The buckets (PROPOSED — awaiting team confirmation)

| Bucket | Base | Threshold | Outcome | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CARRIER | 0.70 | 0.60 | Passes | Capacity cuts and rate changes move cost and service directly |
| SUPPLIER | 0.70 | 0.60 | Passes | Outages propagate into inbound flow and safety stock |
| CUSTOMER | 0.70 | 0.60 | Passes | Expansion/contraction changes demand at specific zones |
| MACRO | 0.45 | 0.60 | Needs materiality ≥ 5% | Real, but small moves are noise |
| WEATHER | 0.65 | 0.60 | Passes, expires after 30 days | Genuine but short-lived |
| COMPETITOR | 0.10 | 0.95 | **Excluded by default** | Team judged it low signal-to-noise |
| UNKNOWN | 0.20 | 0.80 | Held back | Unclassifiable ≠ relevant |

### Two special rules

**Materiality (MACRO).** A move below 5% is logged, not surfaced. A move above it earns a `+0.20` bonus — because a network-wide signal like a fuel price rise affects every lane but can name no individual facility, so it can never earn the entity-match bonus. Without this, a major fuel shock would score *lower* than a trivial site-specific one.

**Expiry (WEATHER).** A signal older than 30 days is filtered. A cyclone from January must not remain an active assumption in August.

### Auditability — the non-negotiable

**Filtered signals are never deleted.** Every signal is stored with a verdict recording its bucket, score, threshold and a written reason. A silent filter is indistinguishable from a broken one.

### Current limitation
Signals are read from a seeded JSON file. There is **no live news feed** wired up. The structure and the filter are real; the source is manual.

---

## 7. Versioning

Every assembled network is saved as JSON, named with a SHA-256 hash of its own contents:

```
data/curated/4a7dcfef616aee27.json
```

- Same inputs → same version id (re-runs overwrite, never duplicate)
- Any input change → new version id
- So any KPI can be traced to the exact data that produced it

A `_manifest.json` indexes every version with a timestamp and label.

---

## 8. Is any of this industry-specific?

**No.** The split, honestly:

**Generic — works for pharma, FMCG, automotive, retail, anything**
- The four-path architecture (clean exports / messy files / documents / external signals)
- Every row-level validation rule in §2
- Storage, versioning, snapshots, reporting
- AI column mapping, contract extraction, confidence flagging
- The guardrail mechanism (bucket → score → threshold → audit)

**Configuration, not code — changeable without touching Python**
- Guardrail buckets, thresholds, trigger keywords → `thresholds.yaml`
- Currency, units, products → data files

**Geography-specific — three narrow items**
1. A coordinate range that **warns** (never rejects) if a facility falls outside India. One constant, one file.
2. The sample dataset (Baddi, Delhi NCR, Rs. pricing) — demo data, not pipeline logic.
3. Some trigger keywords ("monsoon", "GST", "PPAC") — in the YAML.

Nothing assumes consumer durables, India, or even physical goods. Pointed at a European pharma network with different CSVs, the pipeline runs unchanged; you would widen one coordinate constant and edit some keywords.

---

## 8b. Client field names (the workbook contract)

`NetGravity_Input_Data_Fields.xlsx` is the specification handed to a client.
Its field names are the **official input contract** — data arriving in exactly
that format loads without modification.

The engine's internal schema uses different names. `netgravity/ingestion/field_aliases.py`
translates between them:

| Workbook (client sends) | Internal (engine uses) |
|---|---|
| `Facility_ID` | `id` |
| `Type` | `role` |
| `Capacity_Units` | `capacity_units_per_period` |
| `Fixed_Annual_Cost` | `fixed_cost_per_year` |
| `Variable_Handling_Cost_Per_Unit` | `handling_cost_per_unit` |
| `Mandatory_Open_Flag` | `is_mandatory` |
| `Observed_Throughput_Units` | `observed_throughput` |
| `Zone_ID` / `Zone_Name` | `market_id` / `market_name` |
| `Daily_Demand_Units` | `quantity` |
| `SLA_Requirement` | `sla_days` |
| `Unit_Cost` | `rate_per_unit` |
| `Current_Lane_Flag` | `is_active_baseline` |
| `Weight` | `weight_kg` |

Rules:
- Matching is case- and separator-insensitive: `Facility_ID`, `facility id` and
  `FACILITY-ID` all resolve.
- Internal names also work, so existing files keep loading.
- Unrecognised columns are preserved, not dropped.
- **Demand may arrive on the Demand Zones sheet** (as the workbook defines it)
  rather than as a separate table. Both are supported; a dedicated demand file
  takes precedence when present. With more than one product in the catalogue a
  `Product_ID` column becomes mandatory, because splitting a zone total across
  products would be a guess that silently changes the optimum.

When the workbook changes, update `field_aliases.py` — not the parsers.

---

## 9. Where each rule lives

| Rules | File |
|---|---|
| Row-level checks (R-001…R-011) | `netgravity/ingestion/validation/row_checks.py` |
| Per-file parsing and repair | `netgravity/ingestion/adapters/structured.py` |
| Guardrail policy (editable) | `netgravity/ingestion/guardrails/thresholds.yaml` |
| Guardrail scoring | `netgravity/ingestion/guardrails/relevance.py` |
| Surcharge arithmetic | `netgravity/ingestion/schemas/contract.py` |
| Mapping confidence rules | `netgravity/ingestion/schemas/mapping.py` |
| Versioning | `netgravity/ingestion/snapshot.py` |
| Client field-name aliases | `netgravity/ingestion/field_aliases.py` |
| PDF text-quality thresholds | `netgravity/ingestion/pdf_quality.py` |
| Content type → destination routing | `netgravity/ingestion/schemas/content.py` |
| Classification confidence bars | `netgravity/ingestion/ai/classifier.py` |
| Mapping confidence + confirmation bars | `netgravity/ingestion/ai/field_mapper.py` |
| Memory generalisation threshold | `netgravity/ingestion/memory/field_memory.py` |
| Document shape similarity threshold | `netgravity/ingestion/memory/document_memory.py` |

Every rule above is covered by a test in `netgravity/tests/ingestion/`. Test names read as specifications — `pytest netgravity/tests/ingestion --collect-only -q` lists them.

---

## 10. PDF reading — when text is trusted, and when it is not

`pypdf` runs first because it is free and instant. But it fails in two ways,
and only one is obvious.

**Loud failure** — a scan has no text layer, extraction returns nothing. Easy
to detect.

**Quiet failure** — extraction returns text, and the text is wrong. A broken
font encoding produces symbol soup; some generators emit table cells out of
reading order. Nothing downstream can tell this from a real contract, so the
model is handed garbage and dutifully "extracts" rates that were never in the
document. This is the dangerous one, because the output is confident and
wrong rather than an error.

Three checks decide whether extracted text is trustworthy. If ANY trips, the
the extracted text is still used but everything from it is marked LOW
confidence and flagged (R-027) — see 'One route only' below.

| Check | Threshold | Signature it catches |
|---|---|---|
| Characters per page | `MIN_CHARS_PER_PAGE = 100` | A text layer that exists but is hollow — typical of a scan carrying only a stamped header |
| Real-word ratio | `MIN_WORD_RATIO = 0.60`, only applied above `MIN_TOKENS_FOR_RATIO = 20` tokens | Mojibake and broken encodings. Numbers count as real content — a pin-code annexure is almost entirely digits |
| Repeated character run | `MAX_SINGLE_CHAR_RUN = 30`, **alphanumerics only** | A corrupt text layer emitting filler |

The alphanumeric restriction on the third check is not cosmetic. An earlier
version matched any repeated character and flagged both shipped sample
contracts as corrupt, because each opens with a 64-character `=` rule.
Punctuation runs and space padding are ordinary document decoration.

**Tie-break rule:** every threshold is set so an ambiguous case ESCALATES.
Escalating a clean PDF costs a fraction of a cent. Accepting a garbled one
puts invented figures into a cost model. Those are not symmetric risks.

All four constants live in `netgravity/ingestion/pdf_quality.py` and are the
entire policy — changing strictness never requires touching adapter logic.

### One route only (simplified 2026-08-21)

The pipeline has exactly one way to read a PDF: **pypdf extracts the text,
the text goes to the model.** There is no second route.

An earlier design escalated documents pypdf could not read by sending the
PDF file itself to the model. That was **removed after live testing**:
Gemini, via the OpenAI-compatible base URL this project uses, rejects
document parts outright with `400 Invalid content part type: file`. The
escalation could therefore only ever spend an API call to rediscover the
same error. Anthropic's API does support document input, and the client
code for it (`_pdf_anthropic`) is still present and tested — it is simply
not wired into this flow.

So the quality checks above are no longer a ROUTING decision. They are a
CONFIDENCE signal:

| pypdf result | What happens |
|---|---|
| Good text | Extracted normally. The everyday case. |
| Text that fails the checks | **Still sent to the model** — imperfect text is all we have, and a corrupt text layer is often only partly corrupt. The result is ring-fenced (below). |
| No text at all | Rejected as unreadable (R-027). **No API call is made** — an unreadable file costs nothing. |

### Ring-fencing a degraded read (R-027)

When text that failed the checks is used anyway, three things are enforced
so a salvage job is never mistaken for a clean read:

1. **Confidence is forced to LOW** on the rule and on every surcharge,
   whatever the model claimed. The model scored its certainty from the text
   it was handed; it had no way to know that text was already judged
   untrustworthy, so the pipeline applies that judgement.
2. **It is never cached.** A degraded read must not be silently served later
   as though it were sound.
3. **It never feeds document-shape memory.** Learning the wording shape of
   text known to be corrupt would poison every future match.

**OCR is PARKED, not built.** A page with no text layer is an image, and
reading it needs OCR — deliberately deferred. Until then, an unreadable file
is reported as unreadable, with the reason named, rather than being filled
with assumed values.

---

## 11. What a column means — three opinions, and what memory keeps

Column mapping combines three independent opinions rather than trusting one.

| Opinion | Sees context? | Cost | Repeatable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Memory** — what a human already confirmed | n/a | free | yes |
| **Model** — reads columns AND sample rows | yes | a model call | approximately |
| **Dictionary** — the static alias table | no | free | exactly |

The dictionary is not there for its answers. It is there for its
**disagreements**. The dangerous failure is not the ambiguous column, which
gets flagged either way — it is the column that maps confidently and wrongly
because the header looked obvious. A model's own confidence cannot catch
that; a model can be 95% sure and wrong. A second method with different blind
spots can, because divergence between two independent approaches is evidence
in itself.

### When a mapping applies without asking

| Situation | Applied? |
|---|---|
| Memory has an exact or generalised confirmation | yes |
| Model and dictionary independently agree, staging-bound data | yes |
| Model and dictionary disagree | no — asked, naming both readings |
| First sighting, no dictionary entry | no — asked once, then remembered |
| **Any** optimiser-bound column, however confident | no — confirmed once, then remembered |

Optimiser-bound content (facility, market, product, demand, lane) gets the
stricter bar because a wrong mapping there produces an authoritative-looking
wrong recommendation. Staging-bound content (shipment logs, historical
volume) costs a bad forecast. Different risk, different bar.

### How far a confirmation travels

Nothing is hardcoded as "always sender-specific" or "always universal".
Scope is resolved from evidence:

| Scope | Condition | Asked again? |
|---|---|---|
| `exact` | this sender confirmed this column, in this content type | no |
| `generalised` | ≥ `GENERALISE_AFTER_SOURCES` (2) other senders independently agreed | no |
| `suggested` | exactly one other sender confirmed it — not yet a pattern | yes |
| `conflict` | senders confirmed DIFFERENT meanings | yes, naming who said what |
| `none` | never seen | yes |

**Content type is always part of the key.** A confirmation on a shipment log
says nothing about the same column on a product sheet — that is the guard
against `Qty` meaning units-shipped in one file and units-returned in another.

A `conflict` is the most valuable output: rather than picking the majority
answer, the disagreement and its evidence are handed to the review layer,
which turns it into a specific question — *"Qty has meant quantity (confirmed
by vendor_a, vendor_b) and returns_volume (confirmed by vendor_d) before.
Which does it mean in this file?"* — instead of a bare low-confidence flag.

### Documents (PDFs) remember shape, not columns

A contract has no columns and no short repeating token like `Qty` to key on —
one vendor writes "a fuel surcharge of Rs. 2.00 per kg", another phrases the
identical concept completely differently. So document memory matches on
**wording shape**, dropping digits so a renewal with new rates still
recognises its template (`SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.75`). It is deliberately
NOT keyed on vendor: several vendors may share a broker's template, and one
vendor may use different templates per service line.

---

## 12. Routing — decided by content, never by folder

Ingestion used to infer meaning from the path: anything under `distributors/`
was shipment data, anything else was network master data. A distributor can
send a facility list and a client can send shipment history, so the folder was
never reliable evidence.

| Content type | Destination | Why |
|---|---|---|
| FACILITY, MARKET, PRODUCT, DEMAND, LANE | `network` | Becomes the CanonicalNetwork the MILP solves against |
| SHIPMENT_LOG, HISTORICAL_VOLUME | `staging` | Forecasting input. Loading it into the network would silently alter the Digital Twin |
| UNKNOWN | `hold` | Held for a human to label rather than guessed at |

Classification reads the ROW DATA, not just the headers, because the
distinguishing pattern only exists in the rows: a master list has one row per
distinct entity, a transaction log repeats the same entities over time.

---

## 13. Token usage — one ledger for every AI call

Token spend is invisible until it is a problem. A provider dashboard gives
a monthly total; it cannot tell you that one step of one run burned most of
it. So every model call in NetGravity records to a single ledger, tagged
with the task that made it.

**It lives OUTSIDE the ingestion package**, at
`netgravity/telemetry/token_usage.py`. Cost is a property of the run, not of
a subsystem — a per-subsystem counter would have to be summed by hand and
would silently miss any new caller that forgot to register itself. Anything
that calls a model uses this, ingestion or not.

Recording, from anywhere in the codebase:

```python
from netgravity.telemetry import record_call

record_call(task="contract extraction", model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",
            usage={"prompt_tokens": 900, "completion_tokens": 120,
                   "total_tokens": 1020})
```

Reading, at the end of a run:

```python
from netgravity.telemetry import ledger
print(ledger().summary())
```

That is the whole API. Ingestion needs no further wiring — every call already
routes through `ai/client.py`, which records on all six outcomes (stub,
live, and failure, for both the text and document paths), so a new ingestion
call site is counted automatically.

### The rules it enforces

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| A stub call is counted but never priced | Stubs cost nothing; pricing them would invent spend that never happened |
| A FAILED live call is counted separately, not folded in with stubs | The provider may well have billed for it — a run of failures must not read as a cheap run |
| An unknown model returns cost `None`, never `0.0` | `None` renders as "cost unknown"; `0.0` renders as free, which is a confident wrong number |
| A total covering only some calls is labelled `PARTIAL` | A partial total passed off as complete is worse than no total |
| Recording never raises | Accounting is a bystander to the work; a malformed usage payload must not break an extraction that otherwise succeeded |

### Prices

Rates live in `_DEFAULT_PRICES` as USD per million tokens, `(input, output)`.
They are **estimates for local visibility, not an invoice** — provider prices
change without notice and the provider's billing is always the authority.

Rates change more often than code should, so they are overridable without an
edit:

```
NETGRAVITY_TOKEN_PRICES="my-model:0.25:2.00,other-model:1.0:3.0"
```

A model with no configured rate is not guessed at. Its tokens are still
counted; only its cost is reported as unknown.

---

## 14. Providers — and what the gateway changes

Every model call goes through `ai/client.py`. Three providers are wired up,
chosen by switch in `.env`:

| Switch | Provider | Transport |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | `openai` | OpenAI SDK. Also reaches any OpenAI-COMPATIBLE server via `NETGRAVITY_LLM_BASE_URL` — OpenRouter, Groq, Cerebras, Gemini |
| `NETGRAVITY_USE_CLAUDE=true` | `anthropic` | Anthropic SDK |
| `NETGRAVITY_USE_GATEWAY=true` | `gateway` | Hand-rolled over stdlib `urllib` |

`NETGRAVITY_USE_GATEWAY` is checked first: it names a specific internal
endpoint, so switching it on is unambiguous.

### Why the gateway needs its own code path

It is **not** OpenAI-compatible, so it cannot be reached by pointing the
OpenAI SDK at it. Its whole protocol is one endpoint taking one field:

```
POST {base}/v1/generate     Authorization: Bearer <token>
{"prompt": "..."}        <- exactly one field; any other is rejected
```

`NETGRAVITY_GATEWAY_URL` is therefore deliberately **separate** from
`NETGRAVITY_LLM_BASE_URL`. The latter means "an OpenAI-compatible server
lives here"; putting a gateway address in it would hand a non-compatible
endpoint to the OpenAI SDK and fail confusingly.

### What it cannot do

| | |
|---|---|
| Model choice | None — fixed server-side |
| Max output | 2,000 tokens; `max_tokens` from a call site is ignored |
| Max prompt | 100,000 characters — **checked locally before sending**, so an oversized prompt fails with a clear message instead of a 413 |
| JSON mode | Not available. "Reply with JSON only" is appended to every gateway prompt, and `_parse_json()` (which already tolerates prose and code fences) is the enforcement |
| PDF / documents | Not supported at all. `extract_json_from_pdf` raises with that stated plainly, rather than a generic "not implemented" |

### Retry policy, and why it is unusually cautious

The budget behind the gateway is **shared with everyone holding the same
token** and **cumulative — it does not reset daily**. So retries are scoped
tightly:

| Outcome | Retried? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 429 `rate_limit_exceeded` | **Yes**, exponential backoff + jitter | A rolling-minute limit clears by itself. Jitter matters because the limit is shared — without it, throttled callers retry in lockstep and re-throttle each other |
| 500 / 502 | **Yes** | Transient server-side |
| 429 `daily_limit_exceeded` | **No** | Resets at 00:00 UTC; retrying within a run cannot help |
| 429 `budget_exceeded` | **No** | Cumulative and spent. Retrying cannot make money appear |
| 400 / 401 / 404 / 405 / 413 | **No** | A malformed request stays malformed |
| Client-side timeout | **No** | The call may already have been processed **and billed**, and the gateway accepts no idempotency key — an automatic retry risks paying twice for one answer |

Every failure message names what to do about it, because the status code
alone does not: three different 429s need three different responses.

### Checking the budget before a batch

`fetch_gateway_usage(config)` reads the shared budget and request counters.
It costs no budget and no request quota, so it is worth calling before any
batch run.

## 15. Market intelligence — three ways in, one schema, one guardrail

External information (a fuel price, a port notice, a duty change) arrives
because **a person supplies it**. There is no fetching anywhere in this
pipeline: no HTTP call, no feed reader, no scraper. That is a decision, not a
gap — see "Why nothing fetches" below.

### The three routes

| Route | What arrives | What handles it |
|---|---|---|
| Spreadsheet | one row per signal | The ordinary tabular pipeline. `ContentType.MARKET_SIGNAL` — classification, column mapping, memory and review all apply unchanged |
| Document | a news article, circular or notice (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`) | `adapters/market_intelligence.py` — reads the text, the model structures it |
| Chat | "diesel is up 6%" | `Intent.MARKET_INTELLIGENCE` → `wf_market_intelligence`, via the new `market.score_signal` capability |

All three build the same `MarketIntelligenceSignal` and are scored by the same
guardrail policy (§6). One policy scores everything, whatever door it came
through — but the three routes do not persist it the same way, and chat
carries one narrow, deliberate exception to the date rule below.

### Everything lands in STAGING or the audit trace, never in the network

A signal is context. It shifts an assumption and explains a result; it does
not edit a rate. Routed to the network destination it would become an input
the MILP treats as fact — a headline turned into a number nobody computed,
which is the one thing the architecture forbids.

So a signal never changes a solver input by itself. If one warrants a what-if,
a person asks for the scenario, with the quantity they chose, through the
workflow built to govern structural change.

Spreadsheet and document signals are batches of records meant to be reviewed
later, so they are written to the staging zone like any other tabular content.
A chat-typed signal is not a batch — it is one fact volunteered inside one
conversation turn. It is carried on the `OrchestratorRequest`/`ExecutionContext`
for that turn, scored against the guardrail by `market.score_signal`, and
captured durably in that turn's audit trace (`trace.engine_results
["market.score_signal"]`), which is what the Reasoning Agent reads back as
`market_evidence` when it writes the reply. It is not written to the staging
zone. That reply itself never restates the signal's magnitude or the
guardrail's score as a number — every number in a generated reply is checked
against the MILP/KPI/REI/Risk/Scenario engines (§ numeric grounding), and a
guardrail score or a reported percentage is not on that list, so the narrative
is deliberately qualitative (category, direction, pass/fail) while the full
record, numbers included, stays inspectable in the trace.

### No probability, ever

`MarketIntelligenceSignal` has no probability field, the spreadsheet aliases
offer no column that becomes one, the document prompt never asks for one, and
the chat spec has no field that could hold one. Four routes in, four closed
doors.

The reason is arithmetic. `RF = P + REI − P·REI`, and governance is decided
from RF. Turning a signal's qualitative `confidence` into a `P` would
manufacture the single number that most directly drives a governed decision,
out of a judgement that was never a likelihood. A genuine event probability
belongs to the orchestrator's own `ExternalSignal` path, and is extracted only
when a source explicitly states one.

If a document states a probability, that is recorded as a fact ABOUT the
document (`states_probability`) and the number itself is not extracted.

### A signal with no stated date is rejected (R-029) — except chat

Not defaulted to today. Every downstream use is time-sensitive — the guardrail
expires weather signals after 30 days — and stamping the ingest date onto an
undated article would make a two-year-old story look like this morning's news.
A signal whose age is unknown is more dangerous than one that is missing.

Chat is the one narrow, documented exception. A typed sentence such as
"diesel is up 6% this week" has no other candidate date to be wrong about —
there is no article date to fail to notice, only the moment the person typed
it. So `chat_service.py` stamps `published_date` as the moment the message
was received (UTC, date-only) and leaves `effective_date` unset, and the
signal defaults to `SignalConfidence.LOW` since nothing about the sentence
was corroborated. This is a deliberate exception scoped to chat only; the
document route still rejects an undated article outright.

### Why nothing fetches

Automated collection was designed and deliberately deferred. The seam for it
already exists one layer up, in `sources/` — the same place an ERP or WMS
connector plugs in — so adding a fetcher later needs no change to the adapter,
the schema, or the guardrail. Nothing was stubbed in the meantime: a stub for
a decision not yet taken is just code to delete.

## 16. Open items

| Item | Owner | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| Confirm guardrail thresholds in §6 | Team member owning guardrail definition | No — defaults work |
| Confirm LLM provider and supply API key | Team | No — stub mode runs everything |
| Live external news feed | Unassigned | No — file, document and chat routes cover intake (§16); the `sources/` seam is ready if automation is wanted |
| Ingestion console UI for mapping confirmation | Deferred (Phase 6) | No — CLI covers it |
| **Capacity period is unstated in the workbook.** `Capacity_Units` is described as "units/day or units/year" with a "units/month" example — three periods in one definition. Ingestion converts whatever the column NAME states and assumes MONTH when it states nothing; R-021 catches the mismatch numerically as a backstop. The workbook should state one period explicitly. | Team + mentor | Partly mitigated — R-021 blocks the silent failure, but the spec is still ambiguous |
