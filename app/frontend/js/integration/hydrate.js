/**
 * NetGravity — Authoritative Hydration
 * ====================================
 * Fills the prototype's own data structures (`js/data.js`) with real, solved
 * values from the backend, so every existing screen renders authoritative data
 * without a single change to its markup or layout.
 *
 * Why this shape
 * --------------
 * Eight frontend modules import from `data.js`. Reassigning its exports is not
 * possible (they are `const`), but mutating the arrays and objects in place is
 * — and ES module bindings mean every consumer sees the mutation immediately.
 * `data.js` already used that technique in `loadNetworkData()`. This module
 * does the same thing with authoritative figures instead of invented ones.
 *
 * What it refuses to do
 * ---------------------
 * `loadNetworkData()` fabricated where the upload was silent: SLA fixed at
 * 96.5, on-time at 97.2, storage cost at 45,000, and — worst — it derived an
 * "optimised" case by multiplying cost by 0.94 and labelled the result
 * `source: "DETERMINISTIC_ENGINE"`. Nothing here invents a value. A metric the
 * backend reports as non-VALID is left absent, and the screens that read it
 * show their own empty state.
