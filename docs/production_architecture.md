# NetGravity — Production Architecture

**Phase 10.0.** Describes what is implemented, not what is intended. Anything
not built is in `validation/phase_10_0/integration_gap_analysis.md`.

```

The orchestration spine and the engines were built in Phases 8.1–9.1 and are
unchanged by this phase. Phase 10.0 built the **application layer** above them
and corrected the frontend paths that bypassed them.

## 2. The binding that makes it a product

A project is analysable only when a network snapshot is bound to it:

```
upload → parse → detect → map → review → confirm      (netgravity/ingestion/)
      → CanonicalNetwork                              (ingestion/builder.py)
      → Orchestrator.register_network()               (state/stores.py)
      → snapshot_id                                   content-addressed
      → ProjectRecord.snapshot_id                     (services/project_registry.py)
      → OrchestratorRequest(network_snapshot_id=…)    pinned; always wins
```

Before this phase the chain was severed at step three: one process-global
orchestrator was built at import from a synthetic fixture, and every project
pointed at it. The primitives for the fix already existed and were already
tested; what was missing was the edge between them.

**Consequences that follow from the binding, not from extra machinery:**

- A project with no ingested data has `snapshot_id = None` and every analytical
  endpoint answers `409 NO_NETWORK_BOUND`. It never borrows another network.
- Two projects cannot share state, because every request pins its own snapshot.
- The bundled synthetic network still exists, but as an explicitly labelled
  demo workspace (`is_demo`, "Case-16 Demo Network (synthetic)"), not as the
  implicit default a real project inherits.

## 3. Authority rules the code enforces

| Question | Authority | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| What does the network cost? | `optimization/milp.py` | Only capability that writes `NetworkStateResult` |
| What will demand be? | `forecasting/` | `forecast.demand` capability; refuses without history |
| How exposed is a facility? | `resilience/rei.py` | `resilience.assess` |
| What is the risk factor? | `risk/risk_factor.py` (`RF = P + REI − P·REI`) | `risk.compute_rf` |
| Is a number trustworthy? | `KPIResult.status` | Constructor invariant: a non-VALID status may not carry a value |
| What may the LLM assert? | `validation/numeric_grounding.py` | `_FACT_SPEC` whitelist |
| May an action execute? | `governance/` | `governance.classify` |

The LLM never calculates, never executes a tool, and never overrides a solver
result. Verified live with the gateway both configured and unavailable.

---

## 4. Failure vocabulary

Every layer fails explicitly (brief §24). No failure becomes a business value.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` / `FORBIDDEN` | No valid session / not your project |
| `NO_NETWORK_BOUND` | Project exists, has no ingested network |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Malformed request |
| `INGESTION_ERROR` | No uploaded file could be parsed |
| `FORECAST_FAILURE` / `FORECAST_UNAVAILABLE` | Engine failed / no observed history |
| `CAPABILITY_FAILURE` | A capability raised during execution |
| `ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE` | Orchestrator not mounted |
| `KPIStatus.INFEASIBLE` | The solve was infeasible — not a cheaper network |
| `KPIStatus.INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` | Inputs absent — not zero |

---

## 5. Frontend

Two entry points, deliberately:

- **`production.html`** — the production console. Imports no mock data. Every
  figure is a `KPIResult` rendered with its status; a non-VALID metric renders
  "Unavailable"/"Infeasible" with a badge, never a number. Uses the prototype's
  stylesheet and design tokens, so the visual language is unchanged.
- **`index.html`** — the approved prototype. Its authoritative paths were
  corrected (scenario creation, chatbot failure) but several screens still read
  `js/data.js`. See the gap analysis; this is stated, not hidden.

`js/integration/` is shared by both: `api-client` (timeouts, correlation IDs,
normalized errors, bearer token), `project-context` (active project + change
notification), typed services, and mappers that preserve status.

---

## 6. Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NETGRAVITY_ENV` | `development` | `production` disables debug and tightens CORS |
| `NETGRAVITY_CORS_ORIGINS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated allowlist; empty ⇒ same-origin |
| `NETGRAVITY_HOST` / `_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `5050` | Bind address |
| `NETGRAVITY_DEBUG` | `0` | Opt-in; ignored in production |
| `NETGRAVITY_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | 64 MiB | Request body cap |
| `NETGRAVITY_SEED_DEMO` | `1` | Seed the synthetic demo workspace |
| `TEXT_API_URL` / `TEXT_API_TOKEN` | — | LLM gateway; absent ⇒ deterministic |

No credential appears in source; `.env` is gitignored.

Deployment configuration, migrations, backups and the identity
controls are documented separately in **[operations.md](operations.md)**.

## 7. What this architecture does not yet provide

Stated here so the document cannot be read as a completeness claim:

- ~~**Durable persistence.**~~ Delivered. Accounts, sessions, projects,
  snapshots, uploaded history, analyses, solved scenarios, security counters,
  and audit traces are JSON records in **Azure Blob Storage**. ETags protect
  atomic single-record changes; SQLite is only the zero-setup local fixture.
- ~~**Ingestion → project binding through the UI.**~~ Delivered. The Next.js
  data workspace previews mappings and quality before committing a canonical
  network to a project.
- ~~**Rate limiting.**~~ Delivered on credential and solver-heavy endpoints,
  with counters shared through the durable Blob store.
- ~~**Horizontal backend scaling.**~~ Delivered for the supplied Azure
  deployment. Blob-backed collection versions invalidate process-local domain
  registries, including published Digital Twin states, across Python replicas;
  the backend scales from one to four replicas. Cookie affinity keeps an active
  execution on its originating replica while durable results and domain records
  remain shared through Blob.

These are tracked with severities in
`validation/phase_10_0/integration_gap_analysis.md`.
