"""
NetGravity — Uploaded Demand History Store
==========================================
Holds the observed demand history that came in with a user's upload, and hands
it to the orchestrator's `forecast.demand` capability.

Why this exists
---------------
The forecasting engine, the `history_provider` service hook and the
snapshot-scoped `series_for_network` filter were all already built and tested.
The only missing link was that an *uploaded* network's history never reached
them: `app.py` registered a provider that reads the ingestion staging zone on
disk, and the API upload path writes to no staging zone. So every uploaded
network reported "no observed demand history", and the forecast screen stayed
empty no matter how much history the workbook contained — the sample workbook
carries 504 observations across 36 months.

This module does not forecast. It stores observations and returns them for a
snapshot, keyed by `network_id` so one project's history can never be served
for another project's network.
