Action items, and the Action Agent that dispatches them.

WHAT AN ACTION IS
-----------------
Something a person has to do that this system cannot do for them, stated
with what it is blocking. Today there is one source: the data-completeness
gate (netgravity/ingestion/completeness.py), run over the committed upload
by `services/completeness_adapter.py`. A required gap means the analysis is
running without a field it needs from a named site; an optional gap means
the analysis ran, and a field would have unlocked more of it.

The envelope is deliberately wider than that one source. Governance already
produces two more kinds — an APPROVAL_REQUIRED card and a HUMAN_ONLY
"please investigate" card, both of which the Action Agent already emails
(orchestrator `_notify_action_agent`). They are not listed here yet because
this endpoint is project-scoped and those are execution-scoped; when that
join exists they become two more `kind`s in the same list, and the frontend
does not change.

WHAT THE AGENT IS, AND IS NOT
-----------------------------
A dispatcher. Every word it sends traces back to something already computed:
the completeness registry's own field labels and the named entities missing
them. It never composes a claim about the network, never runs a scenario,
and never decides that something is worth sending — it is told.

Nothing is sent without a person pressing send. There is no background
dispatcher on this path: the emails the *pipeline* fires (missing data on an
ingestion session, a governance card) are a separate, already-built trigger;
this endpoint is the human-initiated one, from the insight detail screen.

STUB MODE IS REPORTED, NOT HIDDEN
---------------------------------
With no NETGRAVITY_SMTP_HOST / NETGRAVITY_EMAIL_API_KEY configured — the
default, and the state this repository ships in — `EmailSender` logs the
message and returns a labelled stub result. This endpoint passes that label
straight through as `delivery: "stubbed"`, and the UI says so on the button
that was just pressed. A stub reported as a send is the one outcome that
would make this feature worse than not having it.

AND NEITHER IS A REAL FAILURE
-----------------------------
Which is what this endpoint got wrong. It rebuilt the three-way verdict from
the sender's flags, testing `stubbed` before `failed` — and a degraded live
failure sets both. So a configured mail server that rejected the message was
reported as "no mail server is configured": the operator is sent to set a
variable that is already set, and the SMTP error nobody saw is the one thing
that would have told them what was wrong. The verdict now comes from
`EmailSendResult.outcome`, derived once, on the result.

`partial` is the fourth state and a real one: `SMTP.send_message` raises only
when it rejects EVERY address, so one mistyped address in a list of four came
back as a clean send. Whoever was refused is named.
