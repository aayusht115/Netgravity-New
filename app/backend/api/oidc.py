"""
NetGravity — OpenID Connect sign-in endpoints
=============================================

    GET  /api/auth/oidc/providers   is SSO available, and what is it called?
    GET  /api/auth/oidc/start       begin sign-in (302 to the provider)
    GET  /api/auth/oidc/callback    the provider's redirect back
    GET  /api/auth/oidc/identities  the federated links on this account
    DELETE /api/auth/oidc/identities/<issuer>/<subject>   unlink one

Shape of the flow
-----------------
`/start` mints `state`, `nonce` and a PKCE verifier, stores them SERVER-SIDE
(`app_state`, not a cookie the client also controls), and redirects. `/callback`
looks the pending request up by `state`, consumes it, redeems the code with the
verifier, verifies the ID token, and issues an ordinary NetGravity session — the
same session a password login issues, through the same helper, so everything
downstream is unchanged.

Errors redirect back to the landing page with a short reason rather than
returning JSON. A browser arriving here has been sent by the provider and needs
to end up somewhere it can read; a JSON body would be shown as raw text.

Nothing in the reason parameter is provider output. A provider's error body can
carry the code or the client secret, and a message assembled from it would put
them in a URL, in a browser's history, and in an access log.
