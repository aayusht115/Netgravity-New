"""
What the mail path would have got wrong on the day it was switched on, and
what the recommendation card was making a reader assemble for themselves.

THE MAIL PATH
-------------
Both faults here are invisible in the state this repository ships in — no
outbound credential — and both appear the moment one is configured.

  * A REFUSED RECIPIENT READ AS A DELIVERED ONE. `SMTP.send_message` raises
    only when it rejects EVERY address. Reject one of four and it returns a
    dict of the failures and no exception, and the old `_send_live` returned
    None and dropped it. Ask four people for a missing column with one address
    mistyped, and the screen said all four were asked.

  * A REJECTED MESSAGE READ AS AN UNCONFIGURED SERVER. The dispatch endpoint
    rebuilt the three-way verdict from the sender's flags, testing `stubbed`
    before `failed` — and a degraded live failure sets both. So a wrong SMTP
    password produced "No outbound mail server is configured on this
    deployment", sending the operator to set a variable that was already set.

THE RECOMMENDATION
------------------
Reported as "difficult to interpret", and measured on the +50% demand run: the
verdict, then a headline about the BASELINE's cost under the scenario's own
name, then the same cost again unformatted ("556,658,494.26" beside the tile
reading "C$556.66M"), then three sentences of attribution arithmetic, then the
figures, then the capacity account, then two warnings — and what to do about
any of it ninth, below the fold.
