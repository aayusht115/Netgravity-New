"""
The mapping-review screen — the one place a user sees what was read from
their file before any of it reaches the optimiser.

Two kinds of check live here.

  * Contract: the parse response has to carry everything the screen renders
    from — a per-sheet role on every row, a canonical field list, the four
    counts. These run against the real Flask app and a real workbook.

  * Assets: the screen must not size itself in the landing page's reference
    pixel, must not advertise a control it does not implement, and must not
    describe the file's contents from anywhere but the parse. These read the
    shipped JS and CSS, because that is where those defects live and a
    browser test would not name them.

Background: the screen was laid out in `--u`, clamp(0.5px, min(0.0598vw,
0.1063vh), 1.32px). At 1366x768 that unit is 0.816, so its 13px table body
rendered at 10.6px — the type shrank with the window and never agreed with
the application it leads into. It also showed 147 columns as one flat list
with no way to reach the ones needing a decision, and a sidebar that listed
the four techniques the mapper uses rather than what it had concluded about
this file.

    Two faults, and they are the same two as the scenario timeout.

    REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS — thirty seconds, the budget for `GET /api/projects`.
    The server reads every sheet, classifies every column, assembles the
    network structure and measures quality before it answers.

    THE MESSAGE. Aborting the fetch does not stop the parse. The server
    finishes, calls `dataset_store.put_preview` and answers 200 into a
    connection nobody is listening on — and `GET /preview/active` then returns
    that exact object. "Not parsed" was said about a file that had been read,
