"""
Insights: whether the engine says anything about a network, and whether it is true.

The reported symptom was "insights are not visible for the uploaded dataset".
There were two causes, and only one of them was the wiring.

**Nothing fetched them.** `HOME_INSIGHTS` and `HOME_ACTION_ITEMS` were
initialised empty, read by the Home feed and the deep dive, and written by
nothing — so the feed rendered "No insights have been generated for this network
yet" permanently. `/api/insights` and its client now close that, and the browser
harness covers it.

**And there was almost nothing to fetch.** The deterministic template emitted a
`KPIInsight` for exactly two themes, Cost and Scenario impact, so a solved
baseline network produced ONE insight — "I see the current cost position
clearly" — whatever the network said. An overloaded DC, a missed SLA and
stranded demand all reached the reader as one cost card. The evidence for all of
them was already in the payload and already narrated in prose; nothing was being
made of it.

This module tests the second half: that the themes exist, that each appears only
when its evidence does, that severity is stated by the engine rather than
guessed from wording, and that every figure quoted survives numeric grounding.
