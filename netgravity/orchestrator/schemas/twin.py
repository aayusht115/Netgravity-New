"""
Orchestrator — Digital Twin state contract.

The typed payload the Orchestrator hands to the Digital Twin, and the views the
Digital Twin hands back out.

    Orchestrator  →  DigitalTwinState  →  DigitalTwinService  →  view / comparison

Three rules shape every model here.

**1. The twin represents; it does not calculate.**
Every number in a `DigitalTwinState` was produced by an authoritative engine —
MILP for decisions, costs and utilisation, REI for exposure, RF for risk — and
is carried through unchanged. There is no field the twin computes from raw
network data, and `twin/` imports no engine (asserted by test).

Comparison is the one place arithmetic happens, and it is subtraction between
two authoritative values that already exist. `compare()` is a listed Digital
Twin responsibility precisely because a delta is a *statement about* two
results, not a new result.

**2. Absence is a value.**
An unavailable KPI is `None` with a matching `UnavailableValue` naming why —
never `0.0`. `0.0` means "measured, and it was zero", which is a different fact
and, for a cost or a fill rate, a dangerous one to invent. `ValueStatus` records
which of the two a reader is looking at.

**3. Scenarios are deltas over a baseline, not copies.**
A scenario state stores only what CHANGED plus `base_state_id`. Nothing here
holds a `CanonicalNetwork`: states reference `snapshot_id`, and the network
itself stays single-sourced in `SnapshotManager`. Ten scenarios on one snapshot
cost ten delta records, not ten networks.
