"""
Digital Twin — state store.

A thread-safe registry of published twin states, keyed by `state_id`. The host
may attach durable persistence hooks; without them it remains a self-contained
in-memory store — the same shape as `SnapshotManager` and `ScenarioStore`, for
the same reason.

Two guarantees the store exists to provide:

**Baseline immutability.** States are frozen models, deep-copied on ingest and
on read. A caller cannot reach into a published baseline and change it, and one
scenario cannot mutate the baseline a sibling scenario is measured against.

**Scenario isolation.** Scenarios are indexed under their parent snapshot but
stored independently. Writing scenario B never touches scenario A's record, and
neither touches the baseline. Concurrency tests assert this rather than assuming
it.
