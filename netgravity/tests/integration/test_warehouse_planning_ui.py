"""
A site the client has PROPOSED, on screen.

The backend half of warehouse planning is covered by
`test_candidate_data_ingestion.py` (the column reaches the model) and
`test_candidate_opening.py` (the solver opens one when it needs to). This is
about what the screens then say, and every assertion here is a sentence that
was measured wrong on a live upload carrying two proposed DCs.

  * "Closed by solver" on a warehouse the client never built. A proposed site
    and a real one the optimiser shut both arrive with `isOpen === false`.
  * A solid green tower in the 3D twin for the same site, because
    `getUtilLabel(null)` returns 'Not solved', which matched no colour branch
    and left the healthy-emerald default.
  * And the one that survived the first fix: "Utilisation 0% Healthy",
    "Headroom 21,000 units/month", "Risk / Bottleneck LOW — Healthy Headroom"
    — on a building that does not exist. The guard tested for a NULL
    utilisation; hydration writes 0 for a site the solve did not use.

These read the shipped sources, in the style of the other screen tests here:
the behaviour is in template strings a headless run can only reach through a
solve, and the property worth protecting is that the branch exists at all.
