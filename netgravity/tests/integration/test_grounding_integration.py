"""
Phase 2 — §13, §14: reasoning and numeric grounding over REAL evidence.

    deterministic evidence → reasoning agent → generated claims
      → numeric grounding → grounded output

The LLM is faked here — deliberately and necessarily. Grounding exists to catch
a model asserting a number the deterministic engines never produced, and a real
model cannot be relied upon to hallucinate on cue. What is NOT faked is the
evidence: every authoritative figure comes from the real MILP and the real REI
engine, so the grounding layer is adjudicating against genuine values.

The §14 case: authoritative cost increase is 16.67%, the model claims 50%.
