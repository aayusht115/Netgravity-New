Orchestrator — Deterministic numeric-claim grounding.

Every numeric claim in generated narrative is checked against authoritative
values. Three verdicts:

    GROUNDED      matches an authoritative value within tolerance
    CONTRADICTED  a value of that kind exists, and the claim disagrees
    UNSUPPORTED   no authoritative value of that kind exists at all

Both failure modes matter, and they are different. CONTRADICTED is the model
misreporting a real figure ("cost rose 50%" when it rose 14.3%). UNSUPPORTED is
the model inventing a figure from nothing ("cost rose 12%" when no cost was
computed). Neither may be returned as fact.
