"""
NetGravity — Uploaded Data → CanonicalNetwork Assembler
=======================================================
Turns the structure extracted from a user's uploaded workbook into a real
`CanonicalNetwork`, so that their own data — not a synthetic fixture — is what
the MILP solves.

This is the step that was missing from the application: the parser produced
plain dicts, the engine consumes `CanonicalNetwork`, and nothing joined them.

What this module does NOT do, deliberately:

  * It does not optimise. Assembly is not analysis.
  * It does not invent facts. Every field it cannot derive from the upload is
    left at the engine's documented default, and every substitution it makes is
    recorded in the returned `assumptions` list so the user can see it. A
    silent default is how a spreadsheet becomes a confident wrong answer.
  * It does not fabricate demand. A network with no demand rows cannot be
    solved, and the caller is told that rather than handed a zero-demand
    network that trivially "succeeds".

#: sized on the peak month, and only a horizon that contains the peak can tell
#: them apart. A longer horizon adds trend rather than seasonality, and trend
#: is already carried — by `_SIGMA_WINDOW` into safety stock, and by the
#: forecasting engine, which is the right instrument for it.
#:
#: This is a bound on what is MODELLED, not on what is kept. The full observed
#: history is still stored (`demand_history_store`) and still measured for
#: variability; the horizon is the part the MILP is asked to reason over.
_HORIZON_PERIODS = 12

#: client network at 82 variables and 0.02 s for one period against 3,032 and
#: 0.13 s for thirty-six. That is affordable because the network is small. The
#: same horizon over a client with four thousand market-product pairs is not,
#: and a planning tool that becomes unusable on a large upload has failed at
#: exactly the size where it is worth the most.
#:
#: So the horizon shortens to fit the budget rather than the budget being
#: assumed. What that costs is stated in the assumptions, never absorbed
#: silently: a client whose horizon was cut needs to know their answer covers
#: fewer months than their file does.
