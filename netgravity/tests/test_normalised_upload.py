"""
Normalised, multi-sheet uploads.
=================================

A real client workbook is *normalised*: demand lives in a monthly history
table, freight rates in a table keyed by lane and product, capacity in a
monthly series, and the markets/lanes sheets carry no demand or rate columns at
all. The extractor originally understood only the denormalised shape and filled
every gap with an invented constant — capacity 10,000 units, freight ₹10/unit,
lead time 1 day, handling ₹4/unit — so a workbook it did not recognise was
solved against uniform fictional economics and reported as the user's own
network.

These tests pin the behaviour that replaced it. The fixture mirrors the
structure of `Dump/NetGravity_Test_Data_Clean.xlsx` but is built in-process, so
the suite does not depend on a file outside the repository.
