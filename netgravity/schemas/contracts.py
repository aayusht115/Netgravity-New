NetGravity — Frozen Deterministic Result Contracts
===================================================
Version: 1.4.0

The stable interface between the deterministic MILP core and everything built
on top of it (the Orchestrator Agent and Risk Factor calculator in the next
phase).

Why these exist
───────────────
`OptimizationResult` is the engine's native output and carries solver internals.
Downstream consumers must be able to reason about a run WITHOUT reading MILP
internals, and must not break when the formulation is refactored. These
contracts are that boundary: a flat, self-describing, JSON-serialisable summary
of one deterministic run.

Contract guarantees
───────────────────
1. Every result identifies the network/data snapshot it was produced from
   (`network_id` + `data_version`), so downstream reasoning can be tied to
   exact inputs.
2. Every result states its optimization mode and whether it is HYPOTHETICAL.
   An optimized or scenario state can never be mistaken for observed state.
3. Business cost is reported separately from the raw solver objective, with the
   shortage penalty broken out and excluded. Consumers never have to reverse a
   penalty out of an objective.
4. Scenario results carry their overrides explicitly and never overwrite
   observed baseline state.

Deliberately NOT in these contracts
───────────────────────────────────
Risk Factor (RF), disruption likelihood, and any probabilistic or
news-derived judgement. RF is computed later inside the Orchestrator Agent.
What IS provided is the deterministic evidence RF will need — cost impact,
service impact, feasibility, and full cost basis — so the Orchestrator can
calculate RF without reaching back into the MILP.

ForecastResult is intentionally absent: NetGravity has no forecasting module,
and inventing one was out of scope.
