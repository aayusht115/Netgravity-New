"""
NetGravity — Schema migrations
==============================
The schema is a numbered, ordered list of migrations, applied once each and
recorded in `schema_migrations`.

Why this replaced `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
----------------------------------------------
That idiom creates a schema on an empty database and does nothing on a
populated one — which is exactly the wrong behaviour the moment a table needs a
new column. There is no way to express "add `mfa_secret` to `users`" with it, so
the second schema change would have been made by hand on every deployment, or
not at all. The schema had already changed once (the `analyses` table); a
second change to a table with rows in it needs this.

Properties
----------
* **Ordered and recorded.** Each migration has an integer version applied in
  ascending order, and its version is written to `schema_migrations` in the
  SAME transaction as its statements. A migration cannot be half-applied and
  believed complete.
* **Idempotent at the boundary.** Migration 1 is the schema as it stood before
  this module existed, written with `IF NOT EXISTS`, so an already-populated
  database adopts the migration table without its data being touched.
* **Forward only.** There are no down-migrations. A rollback of a schema change
  that has already accepted writes is not a reversal; it is data loss with a
  reassuring name. Roll forward, or restore from a backup taken beforehand.
* **Two dialects, one list.** PostgreSQL and SQLite differ in three places — the
  timestamp type, the placeholder token, and how a script is executed. Each
  migration renders itself per dialect rather than being written twice.
