"""
NetGravity — Binding the stores to durable storage
==================================================
One place where every in-memory store is connected to the database and
reloaded, so start-up order is explicit and the coupling between the engine
package and the application's storage lives at exactly one seam.

`netgravity/` never imports this module. The orchestrator's stores expose a
`persist_hook`/`restore_hook` pair and know nothing about SQLite, JSON columns,
or the application layer — the direction of the dependency is what keeps the
engine usable on its own, which is the same discipline that keeps the
orchestrator blueprint's `authenticator` out of the package.
