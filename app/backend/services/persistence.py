"""
NetGravity — Durable storage
============================
Everything the application must not lose when the process restarts: accounts,
sessions, projects, uploaded networks, analyses, and solved scenarios.

Azure deployments use Azure Blob Storage as the JSON document store.  Each
record is one blob and concurrency-sensitive security records use ETags.  Set:

    NETGRAVITY_STATE_BACKEND=azure_blob
    NETGRAVITY_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL=https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net

Local development and the test suite keep SQLite as a zero-setup fixture.  The
deployable application does not require a database server.  The older SQL
adapter is retained for compatibility with existing local data files, but no
PostgreSQL client is installed by the Azure deployment.

Why the local SQL documents are TEXT
------------------------------------
Every row is a JSON document under typed keys rather than a wide relational
schema: these records are Pydantic models that already know how to serialise
themselves, and re-describing their fields in DDL would create a second
definition of every one of them to keep in step by hand.

They are stored as TEXT rather than JSONB deliberately. JSONB is a normalised
representation — it reorders keys, drops duplicates, and re-renders numbers
through `numeric`. This store's contract is that an uploaded network comes back
exactly as it went in, and that property is asserted by the persistence check.
TEXT keeps one serialisation path with byte fidelity across both backends.
Nothing here queries inside a document; the columns that ARE queried are real
columns with real indexes.

What is deliberately NOT stored
-------------------------------
Live execution contexts. An execution is one in-flight run; the artefacts it
produces — snapshots, scenarios, KPI results and sealed audit traces — are
persisted individually. Persisting a live `ExecutionContext`, which holds typed
solver results, open futures and step state, would be storing a process's stack.
Azure session affinity keeps requests for that short-lived context on its
originating replica while a run is active.
